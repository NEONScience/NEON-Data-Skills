Objectives
---
- Read in a single AOP Hyperspectral Reflectance raster data set at the NEON site SRER
- Link spectral band #s to wavelength values
- Create an inset plot to display the spectral signature of a given pixel upon clicking

Requirements
---
- Complete the introductory AOP GEE tutorials [Intro to AOP Data in GEE](https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/blob/bhass/tutorials-in-development/GEE/01_Intro_AOP_GEE/1a_GEE_AOP_101.md) and [Intro to AOP Hyperspectral Data in GEE](https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/blob/bhass/tutorials-in-development/GEE/02_AOP_Hyperspectral_Lessons/2a_Intro_AOP_Hyperspectral/2a_Intro_AOP_SDR_Rasters.md)
- An understanding of hyperspectral data and AOP spectral data products. If this is your first time working with AOP hyperspectral data, we encourage you to start with the [Intro to Working with Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/hsi-hdf5-r) tutorial. You do not need to follow along with the code in those lessons, but at least read through to gain a better understanding NEON's spectral data products.
