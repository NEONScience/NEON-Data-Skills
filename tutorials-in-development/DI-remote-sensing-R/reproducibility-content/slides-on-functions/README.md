Using functions for modular code
=============

These slides can be used to teach how to make code more functional - starting first with the basic syntax of functions in R, to building functions that help to make plotting figures more straightforward. They were used at the [2016 NEON Data Intitute](http://neon-workwithdata.github.io/neon-data-institute-2016/).

## Before the lesson starts

* Make sure that participants have the following packages installed:
  - raster
  - rmarkdown and knitr (in RStudio pushing the knit HTML button the first time will
    prompt to have these packages installed)
