## What is a data release?

A NEON data Release is a fixed set of data that do not change over time. Each 
data product in a Release is associated with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) 
that can be used for data citation. Since the data in a Release do not change, 
analyses performed on those data are traceable and reproducible.

NEON data are initially published under a Provisional status, meaning that data may be updated on an as-needed basis, without guarantee of reproducibility. Publishing Provisional data allows NEON to publish data rapidly, while retaining the ability to make corrections or additions as they are identified.

After initial publication, a lag time occurs before the data are formally Released. During this lag time, extra quality control (QC) procedures, which are described in data product specific documentation, may be performed. This lag time also ensures all data from laboratory analyses are available before a data Release.

Although data within a Release do not change, NEON may discover errors or needed 
updates to data after publication of a Release. For this reason, NEON generates 
a Release annually; each Release represents the best data available at the 
time of publication. Changes to data between Releases are documented on the 
web page for each Release, and in the issue log for each data product.

### Data citation

Each data product within a Release is associated with a DOI for reference and citation. DOI URLs will always resolve back to their corresponding data product Release’s landing webpage and are thus ideal for citing NEON data in publications and applications.

For more details about NEON data Releases, see the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/data-management/data-revisions-releases" target="_blank">Data Product Revisions and Releases</a> web page.

 * Use appropriate citation information for both Released and Provisional data

## Things You’ll Need To Complete This Tutorial
You will need a version of R (4.0 or higher. This code may work with 
earlier versions but it hasn't been tested) and, preferably, `RStudio` 
loaded on your computer to complete this tutorial.

### Install R Packages

* **neonUtilities:** `install.packages("neonUtilities")`

## Additional Resources

* NEON <a href="http://data.neonscience.org" target="_blank"> Data Portal </a>
* <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/code-hub" target="_blank">NEON Code Hub</a>

</div>

## Set Up R Environment

First install and load the necessary packages.

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}

# install packages. can skip this step if 
# the packages are already installed
install.packages("neonUtilities")

# load packages
library(neonUtilities)
library(ggplot2)

# set working directory
# modify for your computer
setwd("~/data")

```

```{r libraries, include=FALSE}
library(neonUtilities)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Find data of interest

We'll start with the <a href="https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/explore" target="_blank">Explore Data Products</a> page on the NEON Data Portal, 
which has visual interfaces to allow you to select a particular Release, 
and show you which data are included in it.

On the lefthand menu bar, the dropdown menu of Releases shows the available 
releases and the default display, which is the latest Release plus Provisional 
data.

</figure>

Stay on the default menu option for now. Navigate to quantum line 
PAR, DP1.00066.001. Expand the data availability chart by clicking on 
View By: SITE.

What you see will probably not look exactly like this, but similar. This is 
a screenshot from January 2024; more data and possibly more Releases may have 
been published by the time you follow this tutorial.

	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/release-provisional/quantum-line-availability.png" alt="Data availability chart for PAR quantum line."></a>
</figure>

Here we can consult the key and see that data up to June 2023 are in a Release 
(solid boxes) and data collected since June 2023 are Provisional (hatched 
boxes). There are no 2024 data available yet (pale grey boxes). 

Now click on the Product Details button to go to the <a href="https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00066.001" target="_blank">DP1.00066.001</a> web page.

This page contains details and documentation about the data product, including 
citation information for publications using these data.

</figure>

Note that the citation guidance is different for Provisional and Released 
data. The Release citation includes a direct link to a DOI. Since Provisional 
data are subject to change without notice, the data you download today may not 
exactly match data you download tomorrow. Because of this, the recommended 
workflow is to archive the version of Provisional data you used in your 
analyses, and provide a DOI to that archived version for citation. Guidance in 
doing this is available on the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/guidelines-policies/publishing-research-outputs" target="_blank">Publishing Research Outputs</a> web page.

## Downloading data

### Latest and provisional

Go back to the main Explore Data Products page and click on Download Data. 
Select BARR (Utquiagvik) and BONA (Caribou Creek) for the year of 2023. 
Click Next.

<figure>
	<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/release-provisional/include-provisional-menu.png">
	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/release-provisional/include-provisional-menu.png" alt="Radio buttons to select whether to include or exclude Provisional data from download."></a>
</figure>

This page in the download process asks whether you want to download 
provisional data. By default it is set to Exclude, and will only download 
data from the latest Release.

### Download by Release

But let's say you don't want the most recently updated data. You're replicating 
a colleague's analysis, and want to download the precise version of data they 
used. In that case, you need to download the Release they used.

Go back to the Explore Data Products page, and select the Release you need from 
the Release menu on the lefthand bar. For this example, let's use 
RELEASE-2023.

<figure>
	<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/release-provisional/release-2023-menu.png">
	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/release-provisional/release-2023-menu.png" alt="RELEASE-2023 selected in explore data products menu."></a>
</figure>

Now, in the data availability chart, we can see there are no hatched boxes, 
since we've selected only data that are in a Release. And data availability 
extends only through June 2022, the end date for sensor data in RELEASE-2023.

## Downloading data using neonUtilities

NEON data can also be downloaded in R, using the `neonUtilities` package. If 
you're not familiar with the `neonUtilities` package and how to use 
it to access NEON data, we recommend you follow the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/download-explore-neon-data" target="_blank">Download and Explore NEON Data</a> 
tutorial as well as this one, for a more complete introduction.

Let's download a full year of data for two sites, as we did on the Data 
Portal above: TOOL and BONA, January 2023 - December 2023.

(Note: To see the code behavior below, if you are following this tutorial in 
2025 or later, you may need to adjust the dates. In general, use the most 
recent full year of data.)

``` {r load-data, results="hide"}

qpr <- loadByProduct(dpID="DP1.00066.001", 
                     site=c("TOOL", "BONA"),
                     startdate="2023-01",
                     enddate="2023-12",
                     check.size=F)

```

In the messages output as this function runs, you will see:

```

Provisional data were excluded from available files list. To download provisional data, use input parameter include.provisional=TRUE.

```

Just like on the Data Portal, you need to opt in to download Provisional data.

First, let's take a look at the data we downloaded:

```{r plot-release}

gg <- ggplot(qpr$PARQL_30min, 
             aes(endDateTime, linePARMean)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~siteID)
gg

```

As we can see, we downloaded only the data from the first half of 2023, 
the data included in RELEASE-2024.

Now let's download the Provisional data as well:

``` {r load-prov, results="hide"}

qpr <- loadByProduct(dpID="DP1.00066.001", 
                     site=c("TOOL", "BONA"),
                     startdate="2023-01",
                     enddate="2023-12",
                     include.provisional=T,
                     check.size=F)

```

And now plot the full year of data:

```{r plot-release}

gg <- ggplot(qpr$PARQL_30min, 
             aes(endDateTime, linePARMean)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~siteID)
gg

```
