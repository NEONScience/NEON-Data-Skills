    "## Why Set Working Directory\n",
    "Most of NEON's Data Skills tutorials either read in data, write out data, or both. \n",
    "When doing data analysis in Python, you need to tell your computer where \n",
    "to find data that you want to read in, as well as where you want to write data to. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are two ways to describe a file location to your computer. \n",
    "As an analogy, let's say that you wanted to order a pizza to your house. The pizza \n",
    "devliery driver is your computer, the file that you want to find is your house, \n",
    "and the driver's current location is the 'current working directory'. \n",
    " \n",
    "1) You can give your computer the full file path e.g.,\n",
    "    \"C:/Users/myName/Git/data/images/NEON_image.tif\"\n",
    "    This method is similar to giving the pizza delivery driver your full address\n",
    "    that they enter into their smartphone - they can find your house \n",
    "    _no matter where they are starting from._\n",
    "    \n",
    "2) Or, you can give you computer a relative pathway to follow from your current working directory\n",
    "    e.g., \"./data/images/NEON_image.tif\"\n",
    "    Which the computer reads as: \"From my current working directory (\".\"), go into 'data', then \n",
    "    'images' and use the 'NEON_image.tif' file.\n",
    "    This method is similar to telling the delivery driver: \"From the pizzeria, turn left on \n",
    "    Pine Street, right on Catalpa, and I'm the third house on the Right.\" - they can find your \n",
    "    house with few directions, but _only if they start in the right place._\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to give instructions based on the relative pathway, you need to tell the \n",
    "computer where to start (\"From the _pizzeria_...\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "At first, it might seem like it's always easiest to give the full file path, however \n",
    "that can become onerous if you have long filepaths (makes your code messy), and it \n",
    "can also become a problem when you share your code (because \"C:/Users/myName/...\" will have \n",
    "to become \"C:/Users/theirName/...\" in every instance). Ultimately, it easier and far more \n",
    "flexible to use relative filepaths when possible. For most NEON tutorials, we will change \n",
    "the working directory to wherever the example data are before conducting our analysis using \n",
    "relative filepaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading and setting the current working directory\n",
    "\n",
    "To use relative filepaths, you will need to define your current working directory \n",
    "to ensure that your computer can find your data. It can also be very useful (especially \n",
    "when troubleshooting) to have your computer tell you what is its current working directory. \n",
    "In order to interface with these 'operating system'-level functions, we first need to \n",
