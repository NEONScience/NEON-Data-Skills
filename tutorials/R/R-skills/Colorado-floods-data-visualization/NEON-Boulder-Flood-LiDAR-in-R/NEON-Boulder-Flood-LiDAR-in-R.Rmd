<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m7SXoFv6Sdc?rel=0&start=105" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Questions
1. How can LiDAR data be collected?  
2. How might we use LiDAR to help study the 2013 Colorado Floods?

### Additional LiDAR Background Materials
This data activity below assumes basic understanding of remote sensing and 
associated landscape models and the use of raster data and plotting raster objects
in R. Consider using these other resources if you wish to gain more background 
in these areas. 

#### Using LiDAR Data

LiDAR data can be used to create many different models of a landscape.  This
brief lesson on 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/chm-dsm-dtm-gridded-lidar-data" target="_blank">
"What is a CHM, DSM and DTM? About Gridded, Raster LiDAR Data"</a> 
explores three important landscape models that are commonly used.

1. How might we use a CHM, DSM or DTM model to better understand what happened
in the 2013 Colorado Flood? 
2. Would you use only one of the models or could you use two or more of them
together?

In this Data Activity, we will be using Digital Terrain Models (DTMs).

#### More Details on LiDAR

If you are particularly interested in how LiDAR works consider taking a closer
look at how the data are collected and represented by going through this tutorial
on 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/lidar-basics" target="_blank"> "Light Detection and Ranging."</a> 


## Digital Terrain Models 

We can use a digital terrain model (DTM) to view the surface of the earth. By 
comparing a DTM from before a disturbance event with one from after a disturbance
event, we can get measurements of where the landscape changed.  

First, we need to load the necessary R packages to work with raster files and 
set our working directory to the location of our data. 

```{r load-libraries }
# load libraries
library(raster)   # work with raster files
library(rgdal)    # work with raster files

## Set your working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where we want to save our files. Be sure to move the downloaded files into your working directory!
wd <- "~/Git/data/" # This will depend on your local environment
setwd(wd)
```

Then we can read in two DTMs. The first DTM `preDTM3.tif` is a model from data
collected 26-27 June 2013 and the `postDTM3.tif` is a model from data collected
on 8 October 2013.  

```{r open-DTMs }
# Load DTMs into R
DTM_pre <- raster(paste0(wd,"disturb-events-co13/lidar/pre-flood/preDTM3.tif"))
DTM_post <- raster(paste0(wd,"disturb-events-co13/lidar/post-flood/postDTM3.tif"))

# View raster structure
DTM_pre
DTM_post

```

Among the information we now about our data from looking at the raster structure, 
is that the units are in **meters** for both rasters.  

Hillshade layers are models created to add visual depth to maps. It represents
what the terrain would look like in shadow with the sun at a specific azimuth. 
The default azimuth for many hillshades is 315 degrees -- to the NW.  

```{r open-hillshade}

# Creating hillshade for DTM_pre & DTM_post
# In order to generate the hillshde, we need both the slope and the aspect of
# the extent we are working on. 

DTM_pre_slope <- terrain(DTM_pre, opt="slope",units = "radians")
DTM_pre_aspect <- terrain(DTM_pre, opt ="aspect", units = "radians")
DTM_pre_hillshade <- hillShade(DTM_pre_slope, DTM_pre_aspect)

DTM_post_slope <- terrain(DTM_post, opt="slope",units = "radians")
DTM_post_aspect <- terrain(DTM_post, opt ="aspect", units = "radians")
DTM_post_hillshade <- hillShade(DTM_post_slope, DTM_post_aspect)

```

Now we can plot the raster objects (DTM & hillshade) together by using `add=TRUE`
when plotting the second plot. To be able to see the first (hillshade) plot,
through the second (DTM) plot, we also set a value between 0 (transparent) and 1 
(not transparent) for the `alpha=` argument. 

```{r plot-rasters, fig.cap=c("Raster Plot of Four Mile Creek, Boulder County, Pre-Flood. This figure combines the DTM and hillshade raster objects into one plot.","Raster Plot of Four Mile Creek, Boulder County, Post-Flood. This figure combines the DTM and hillshade raster objects into one plot.") }

# plot Pre-flood w/ hillshade
plot(DTM_pre_hillshade,
        col=grey(1:90/100),  # create a color ramp of grey colors for hillshade
        legend=FALSE,         # no legend, we don't care about the grey of the hillshade
        main="Four Mile Canyon Creek, Boulder County\nPre-Flood",
        axes=FALSE)           # makes for a cleaner plot, if the coordinates aren't necessary

plot(DTM_pre, 
        axes=FALSE,
        alpha=0.3,   # sets how transparent the object will be (0=transparent, 1=not transparent)
        add=TRUE)  # add=TRUE (or T), add plot to the previous plotting frame

# plot Post-flood w/ hillshade
# note, no add=T in this code, so new plotting frame. 
plot(DTM_post_hillshade,
        col=grey(1:90/100),  
        legend=FALSE,
        main="Four Mile Canyon Creek, Boulder County\nPost-Flood",
        axes=FALSE)

plot(DTM_post, 
        axes=FALSE,
        alpha=0.3,
        add=T)

```

#### Questions? 

1. What does the color scale represent? 
1. Can you see changes in these two plots?  
1. Zoom in on the main stream bed.  Are changes more visible?  Can you tell 
where erosion has occurred?  Where soil deposition has occurred?  

### Digital Elevation Model of Difference (DoD)

A **D**igital Elevation Model **o**f **D**ifference (DoD) is a model of the 
change (or difference) between two other digital elevation models - in our case
DTMs.  

```{r create-difference-model, fig.cap= "Digital Elevation Model of Difference showing the difference between digital elevation models (DTM)." }
# DoD: erosion to be neg, deposition to be positive, therefore post - pre
DoD <- DTM_post-DTM_pre

plot(DoD,
        main="Digital Elevation Model of Difference (DoD)",
        axes=FALSE)

```

Here we have our DoD, but it is a bit hard to read. What does the scale bar tell
us?  

Everything in the yellow shades are close to 0m of elevation change, those areas
toward green are up to 10m increase of elevation, and those areas to red and 
white are a 5m or more decrease in elevation.  

We can see a distribution of the values better by viewing a histogram of all
the values in the `DoD` raster object. 

```{r hist-DoD, fig.cap= "Histogram of values showing the distribution of values in the Digital Elevation Model of Difference. The values are plotted on the X-axis and the frquency on the Y-axis."}
# histogram of values in DoD
hist(DoD)

```

Most of the areas have a very small elevation change. To make the map easier to
read, we can do two things. 

1. **Set breaks for where we want the color to represent:** The plot of the DoD 
above uses a continuous scale to show the gradation between the loss of 
elevation and the gain in elevation. While this provides a great deal of 
information, in this case with much of the change around 0 and only a few outlying 
values near -5m or 10m a categorical scale could help us visualize the data better.
In the plotting code we can set this with the `breaks=` argument in the `plot()`
function. Let's use breaks of -5, -1, -0.5, 0.5, 1, 10 -- which will give use 5
categories. 

2. **Change the color scheme:** We can specify a color for each of elevation
categories we just specified with the `breaks`. 
<a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/" target="_blank"> 
ColorBrewer 2.0</a> is a great reference for choosing mapping color palettes and 
provide the hex codes we need for specifying the colors of the map. Once we've
chosen appropriate colors, we can create a vector of those colors and then use
that vector with the `col=` argument in the `plot()` function to specify these. 

Let's now implement these two changes in our code. 

```{r pretty-diff-model, fig.cap= "Plot of the Elevation change Post-flood in Four Mile Canyon Creek, Boulder County with elevation change represented in categories (breaks)." }
# Color palette for 5 categories
difCol5 = c("#d7191c","#fdae61","#ffffbf","#abd9e9","#2c7bb6")

# Alternate palette for 7 categories - try it out!
#difCol7 = c("#d73027","#fc8d59","#fee090","#ffffbf","#e0f3f8","#91bfdb","#4575b4")

# plot hillshade first
plot(DTM_post_hillshade,
        col=grey(1:90/100),  # create a color ramp of grey colors
        legend=FALSE,
        main="Elevation Change Post Flood\nFour Mile Canyon Creek, Boulder County",
        axes=FALSE)

# add the DoD to it with specified breaks & colors
plot(DoD,
        breaks = c(-5,-1,-0.5,0.5,1,10),
        col= difCol5,
        axes=FALSE,
        alpha=0.3,
        add =T)

```

#### Question
Do you think this is the best color scheme or set point for the breaks? Create
a new map that uses different colors and/or breaks.  Does it more clearly show 
patterns than this plot? 

## Optional Extension: Crop to Defined Area 

If we want to crop the map to a smaller area, say the mouth of the canyon 
where most of the erosion and deposition appears to have occurred, we can crop 
by using known geographic locations (in the same CRS as the raster object) or
by manually drawing a box. 

#### Method 1: Manually draw cropbox 

```{r crop-raster-man,fig.cap= "Plot of the Elevation change Post-flood in Four Mile Canyon Creek, Boulder County. Figure also includes crop window inlay around the area of interest.", eval=FALSE, comment=NA}
# plot the rasters you want to crop from 
plot(DTM_post_hillshade,
        col=grey(1:90/100),  # create a color ramp of grey colors
        legend=FALSE,
        main="Four Mile Canyon Creek, Boulder County\nPre-Flood",
        axes=FALSE)

plot(DoD,
        breaks = c(-5,-1,-0.5,0.5,1,10),
        col= difCol5,
        axes=FALSE,
        alpha=0.3,
        add =T)

# crop by designating two opposite corners
cropbox1 <- drawExtent()  

```
```{r crop-box-hidden, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
cropbox1 <- extent(473814, 474982, 4434537, 4435390)
```
<figure>
	<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/disturb-events-co13/drawExtent.png">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/disturb-events-co13/drawExtent.png"
  alt= "Plot of the Elevation change Post-flood in Four Mile Canyon Creek, Boulder County. Figure also includes crop window inlay around the area of interest.">
  </a>
</figure>

After executing the `drawExtent()` function, we now physically click on the plot
at the two opposite corners of the box you want to crop to. You should see a 
box drawn on the plot at this point.

When we call this new object, we can view the new extent. 

``` {r crop-raster-man-view}
# view the extent of the cropbox1
cropbox1

```

It is a good idea to write this new extent down, so that you can use the extent
again the next time you use the script. 

#### Method 2: Define the cropbox

If you know the desired extent of the object you can also use it to crop the box, 
by creating an object that is a vector of the x min, x max, y min, and y max of
the desired area. 

```{r crop-raster-coords}
# desired coordinates of the box
cropbox2<-c(473792.6,474999,4434526,4435453)
```

Once you have the crop box defined, either manually or using the coordinate, you 
then crop the desired layer to the crop box. 

```{r plot-crop-raster, fig.cap=c("Raster Plot of the cropped section of Four Mile Creek, Boulder County.","Raster Plot of the cropped section of Four Mile Creek, Boulder County, Post-Flood.","Plot of the Elevation change, Post-flood, in the cropped section of Four Mile Canyon Creek, Boulder County with elevation change represented in categories (breaks).")}
# crop desired layers to this cropbox
DTM_pre_crop <- crop(DTM_pre, cropbox2)
DTM_post_crop <- crop(DTM_post, cropbox2)
DTMpre_hill_crop <- crop(DTM_pre_hillshade,cropbox2)
DTMpost_hill_crop <- crop(DTM_post_hillshade,cropbox2)
DoD_crop <- crop(DoD, cropbox2)

# plot all again using the cropped layers

# PRE
plot(DTMpre_hill_crop,
        col=grey(1:90/100),  # create a color ramp of grey colors
        legend=FALSE,
        main="Four Mile Canyon Creek, Boulder County\nPre-Flood",
        axes=FALSE)
# note \n in the title forces a line break in the title
plot(DTM_pre_crop, 
        axes=FALSE,
        alpha=0.3,
        add=T)

# POST
# plot Post-flood w/ hillshade
plot(DTMpost_hill_crop,
        col=grey(1:90/100),  # create a color ramp of grey colors
        legend=FALSE,
        main="Four Mile Canyon Creek, Boulder County\nPost-Flood",
        axes=FALSE)

plot(DTM_post_crop, 
        axes=FALSE,
        alpha=0.3,
        add=T)

# CHANGE - DoD
plot(DTMpost_hill_crop,
        col=grey(1:90/100),  # create a color ramp of grey colors
        legend=FALSE,
        main="Elevation Change Post Flood\nFour Mile Canyon Creek, Boulder County",
        axes=FALSE)

plot(DoD_crop,
        breaks = c(-5,-1,-0.5,0.5,1,10),
        col= difCol5,
        axes=FALSE,
        alpha=0.3,
        add =T)
```

Now you have a graphic of your particular area of interest.
