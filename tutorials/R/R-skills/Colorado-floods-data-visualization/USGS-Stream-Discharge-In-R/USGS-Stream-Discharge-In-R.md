Several factors contributed to the extreme flooding that occurred in Boulder,
Colorado in 2013. In this data activity, we explore and visualize the data for 
stream discharge data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). 
The tutorial is part of the Data Activities that can be used 
with the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/overview-disturbance-events-co13flood/" target="_blank"> *Quantifying The Drivers and Impacts of Natural Disturbance Events Teaching Module*</a>.

## Research Question 
What were the patterns of stream discharge prior to and during the 2013 flooding
events in Colorado? 

## About the Data - USGS Stream Discharge Data

The USGS has a distributed network of aquatic sensors located in streams across
the United States. This network monitors a suit of variables that are important
to stream morphology and health. One of the metrics that this sensor network
monitors is **Stream Discharge**, a metric which quantifies the volume of water
moving down a stream. Discharge is an ideal metric to quantify flow, which
increases significantly during a flood event.

> As defined by USGS: Discharge is the volume of water moving down a stream or 
> river per unit of time, commonly expressed in cubic feet per second or gallons 
> per day. In general, river discharge is computed by multiplying the area of 
> water in a channel cross section by the average velocity of the water in that 
> cross section.

## Obtain USGS Stream Gauge Data

This next section explains how to find and locate data through the USGS's 
<a href="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis" target="_blank"> National Water Information System portal</a>.
If you want to use the pre-compiled dataset at the FigShare link above, you can skip this 
section and start again at the Work With Stream Gauge Data header.

#### Step 1: Search for the data

To search for stream gauge data in a particular area, we can use the 
<a href="http://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/index.html" target="_blank"> interactive map of all USGS stations</a>.
By searching for locations around "Boulder, CO", we can find 3 gauges in the area. 

For this lesson, we want data collected by USGS stream gauge 06730200 located on 
Boulder Creek at North 75th St. This gauge is one of the few the was able to continuously
collect data throughout the 2013 Boulder floods. 

You can directly access the data for this station through the "Access Data" link
on the map icon or searching for this site on the 
<a href="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis" target="_blank"> National Water Information System portal </a>.

On the 
<a href="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory?agency_code=USGS&site_no=06730200" target="_blank"> Boulder Creek stream gauge 06730200 page</a>
, we can now see summary information about the types of data available for this 
station. We want to select **Daily Data** and then the following parameters: 

* Available Parameters = **00060 Discharge (Mean)**
* Output format = **Tab-separated**
* Begin Date = **1 October 1986**
* End Date = **31 December 2013** 

Now click "Go". 

#### Step 2: Save data to .txt
The output is a plain text page that you must copy into a spreadsheet of 
choice and save as a .csv. Note, you can also download the teaching dataset 
(above) or access the data through an API (see Additional Resources, below). 


# Work with Stream Gauge Data

## R Packages

We will use `ggplot2` to efficiently plot our data and `plotly` to create interactive plots.


    # load packages

    library(ggplot2) # create efficient, professional plots

    library(plotly) # create cool interactive plots

    

    ## Set your working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where we want to save our files. Be sure to move the downloaded files into your working directory!

    wd <- "~/data/" # This will depend on your local environment

    setwd(wd)

##  Import USGS Stream Discharge Data Into R

Now that we better understand the data that we are working with, let's import it into R. First, open up the `discharge/06730200-discharge_daily_1986-2013.txt` file in a text editor. 

What do you notice about the structure of the file?

The first 24 lines are descriptive text and not actual data. Also notice that this file is separated by tabs, not commas. We will need to specify the 
**tab delimiter** when we import our data.We will use the `read.csv()` function to import it into an R object. 

When we use `read.csv()`, we need to define several attributes of the file 
including:

1. The data are tab delimited. We will this tell R to use the `"\\t"` 
**sep**arator, which defines a tab delimited separation.
2. The first group of 24 lines in the file are not data; we will tell R to skip
those lines when it imports the data using `skip=25`.
3. Our data have a header, which is similar to column names in a spreadsheet. We 
will tell R to set `header=TRUE` to ensure the headers are imported as column
names rather than data values.
4. Finally we will set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` to ensure our data come in as individual values.

Let's import our data.

(Note: you can use the `discharge/06730200-discharge_daily_1986-2013.csv` file
and read it in directly using `read.csv()` function and then skip to the **View 
Data Structure** section).


    #import data

    discharge <- read.csv(paste0(wd,"disturb-events-co13/discharge/06730200-discharge_daily_1986-2013.txt"), 
                          sep= "\t", skip=24, 
                          header=TRUE,
                          stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

    

    #view first few lines

    head(discharge)

    ##   agency_cd  site_no   datetime X17663_00060_00003 X17663_00060_00003_cd
    ## 1        5s      15s        20d                14n                   10s
    ## 2      USGS 06730200 1986-10-01                 30                     A
    ## 3      USGS 06730200 1986-10-02                 30                     A
    ## 4      USGS 06730200 1986-10-03                 30                     A
    ## 5      USGS 06730200 1986-10-04                 30                     A
    ## 6      USGS 06730200 1986-10-05                 30                     A

When we import these data, we can see that the first row of data is a second
header row rather than actual data. We can remove the second row of header 
values by selecting all data beginning at row 2 and ending at the
total number or rows in the file and re-assigning it to the variable `discharge`. The `nrow` function will count the total
number of rows in the object.


    # nrow: how many rows are in the R object

    nrow(discharge)

    ## [1] 9955

    # remove the first line from the data frame (which is a second list of headers)

    # the code below selects all rows beginning at row 2 and ending at the total

    # number of rows. 

    discharge <- discharge[2:nrow(discharge),]

## Metadata 
We now have an R object that includes only rows containing data values. Each 
column also has a unique column name. However the column names may not be 
descriptive enough to be useful - what is `X17663_00060_00003`?.

Reopen the `discharge/06730200-discharge_daily_1986-2013.txt` file in a text editor or browser. The text at 
the top provides useful metadata about our data. On rows 10-12, we see that the
values in the 5th column of data are "Discharge, cubic feed per second (Mean)".  Rows 14-16 tell us more about the 6th column of data, 
the quality flags.  

Now that we know what the columns are, let's rename column 5, which contains the
discharge value, as **disValue** and column 6 as **qualFlag** so it is more "human
readable" as we work with it 
in R.


    #view names

    names(discharge)

    ## [1] "agency_cd"             "site_no"               "datetime"              "X17663_00060_00003"   
    ## [5] "X17663_00060_00003_cd"

    #rename the fifth column to disValue representing discharge value

    names(discharge)[4] <- "disValue"

    names(discharge)[5] <- "qualCode"

    

    #view names

    names(discharge)

    ## [1] "agency_cd" "site_no"   "datetime"  "disValue"  "qualCode"

## View Data Structure

Let's have a look at the structure of our data. 


    #view structure of data

    str(discharge)

    ## 'data.frame':	9954 obs. of  5 variables:
    ##  $ agency_cd: chr  "USGS" "USGS" "USGS" "USGS" ...
    ##  $ site_no  : chr  "06730200" "06730200" "06730200" "06730200" ...
    ##  $ datetime : chr  "1986-10-01" "1986-10-02" "1986-10-03" "1986-10-04" ...
    ##  $ disValue : chr  "30" "30" "30" "30" ...
    ##  $ qualCode : chr  "A" "A" "A" "A" ...

It appears as if the discharge value is a `character` (`chr`) class. This is 
likely because we had an additional row in our data. Let's convert the discharge
column to a `numeric` class. In this case, we can reassign that column to be of
class: `integer` given there are no decimal places.


    # view class of the disValue column

    class(discharge$disValue)

    ## [1] "character"

    # convert column to integer

    discharge$disValue <- as.integer(discharge$disValue)

    

    str(discharge)

    ## 'data.frame':	9954 obs. of  5 variables:
    ##  $ agency_cd: chr  "USGS" "USGS" "USGS" "USGS" ...
    ##  $ site_no  : chr  "06730200" "06730200" "06730200" "06730200" ...
    ##  $ datetime : chr  "1986-10-01" "1986-10-02" "1986-10-03" "1986-10-04" ...
    ##  $ disValue : int  30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 31 ...
    ##  $ qualCode : chr  "A" "A" "A" "A" ...


### Converting Time Stamps

We have converted our discharge data to an `integer` class. However, the time
stamp field, `datetime` is still a `character` class. 

To work with and efficiently plot time series data, it is best to convert date
and/or time data to a date/time class. As we have both date and time date, we 
will use the class POSIXct. 

To learn more about different date/time classes, see the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/dc-convert-date-time-POSIX-r" target="_blank" > 
*Dealing With Dates & Times in R - as.Date, POSIXct, POSIXlt*</a> tutorial. 


    #view class

    class(discharge$datetime)

    ## [1] "character"

    #convert to date/time class - POSIX

    discharge$datetime <- as.POSIXct(discharge$datetime, tz ="America/Denver")

    

    #recheck data structure

    str(discharge)

    ## 'data.frame':	9954 obs. of  5 variables:
    ##  $ agency_cd: chr  "USGS" "USGS" "USGS" "USGS" ...
    ##  $ site_no  : chr  "06730200" "06730200" "06730200" "06730200" ...
    ##  $ datetime : POSIXct, format: "1986-10-01" "1986-10-02" "1986-10-03" ...
    ##  $ disValue : int  30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 31 ...
    ##  $ qualCode : chr  "A" "A" "A" "A" ...

### No Data Values
Next, let's query our data to check whether there are no data values in 
it.  The metadata associated with the data doesn't specify what the values would
be, `NA` or `-9999` are common values


    # check total number of NA values

    sum(is.na(discharge$datetime))

    ## [1] 0

    # check for "strange" values that could be an NA indicator

    hist(discharge$disValue)

![Histogram of discharge value. X-axis represents discharge values and the Y-axis shows the frequency.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/R-skills/Colorado-floods-data-visualization/USGS-Stream-Discharge-In-R/rfigs/no-data-values-1.png)

Excellent! The data contains no NoData values.  

## Plot The Data

Finally, we are ready to plot our data. We will use `ggplot` from the `ggplot2`
package to create our plot.


    ggplot(discharge, aes(datetime, disValue)) +
      geom_point() +
      ggtitle("Stream Discharge (CFS) for Boulder Creek") +
      xlab("Date") + ylab("Discharge (Cubic Feet per Second)")

![Stream Discharge for Boulder Creek. X-axis represents the Date and the Y-axis shows the discharge in cubic feet per second.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/R-skills/Colorado-floods-data-visualization/USGS-Stream-Discharge-In-R/rfigs/plot-flood-data-1.png)

#### Questions: 

1. What patterns do you see in the data?  
1. Why might there be an increase in discharge during a particular time of year? 


## Plot Data Time Subsets With ggplot 

We can plot a subset of our data within `ggplot()` by specifying the start and 
end times (in a `limits` object) for the x-axis with `scale_x_datetime`. Let's 
plot data for the months directly around the Boulder flood: August 15 2013 - 
October 15 2013.


    # Define Start and end times for the subset as R objects that are the time class

    start.end <- as.POSIXct(c("2013-08-15 00:00:00","2013-10-15 00:00:00"),tz= "America/Denver")

    

    # plot the data - Aug 15-October 15

    ggplot(discharge,
          aes(datetime,disValue)) +
          geom_point() +
          scale_x_datetime(limits=start.end) +
          xlab("Date") + ylab("Discharge (Cubic Feet per Second)") +
          ggtitle("Stream Discharge (CFS) for Boulder Creek\nAugust 15 - October 15, 2013")

    ## Warning: Removed 9892 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).


![Stream discharge for Boulder Creek for the time period between August 15th and October 15th of 2013. X-axis represents the date and the Y-axis shows the discharge in cubic feet per second.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/R-skills/Colorado-floods-data-visualization/USGS-Stream-Discharge-In-R/rfigs/define-time-subset-1.png)

We get a warning message because we are "ignoring" lots of the data in the
dataset.

## Plotly - Interactive (and Online) Plots

We have now successfully created a plot. We can turn that plot into an interactive
plot using **Plotly**. <a href="https://plot.ly/" target="_blank" >Plotly </a> 
allows you to create interactive plots that can also be shared online. If
you are new to Plotly, view the companion mini-lesson 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/plotly-r/" target="_blank"> *Interactive Data Vizualization with R and Plotly*</a>
to learn how to set up an account and access your username and API key. 

### Time subsets in plotly

To plot a subset of the total data we have to manually subset the data as the Plotly
package doesn't (yet?) recognize the `limits` method of subsetting. 

Here we create a new R object with entries corresponding to just the dates we want and then plot that data. 


    # subset out some of the data - Aug 15 - October 15

    discharge.aug.oct2013 <- subset(discharge, 

                            datetime >= as.POSIXct('2013-08-15 00:00',

                                                  tz = "America/Denver") & 

                            datetime <= as.POSIXct('2013-10-15 23:59', 

                                                  tz = "America/Denver"))

    

    # plot the data

    disPlot.plotly <- ggplot(data=discharge.aug.oct2013,

            aes(datetime,disValue)) +

            geom_point(size=3)     # makes the points larger than default

    

    disPlot.plotly

          

    # add title and labels

    disPlot.plotly <- disPlot.plotly + 

    	theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) +

    	xlab("Time") + ylab("Stream Discharge (CFS)") +

    	ggtitle("Stream Discharge - Boulder Creek 2013")

    

    disPlot.plotly

You can now display your interactive plot in R using the following command: 


    # view plotly plot in R

    ggplotly(disPlot.plotly)

If you are satisfied with your plot you can now publish it to your Plotly account, if desired. 


    # set username

    Sys.setenv("plotly_username"="yourUserNameHere")

    # set user key

    Sys.setenv("plotly_api_key"="yourUserKeyHere")

    

    # publish plotly plot to your plotly online account if you want. 

    api_create(disPlot.plotly)
