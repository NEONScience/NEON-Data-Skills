<p>Several factors contributed to extreme flooding that occurred in Boulder, 
Colorado in 2013. In this data activity, we explore and visualize the data for 
precipitation (rainfall) data collected by the National Weather Service&#39;s 
Cooperative Observer Program. The tutorial is part of the Data Activities that can be used 
with the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/overview-disturbance-events-co13flood/" target="_blank"> <em>Quantifying The Drivers and Impacts of Natural Disturbance Events Teaching Module</em></a>. </p>

<div id="ds-objectives" markdown="1">

## Learning Objectives
After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Download precipitation data from 
<a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">NOAA&rsquo;s National Centers for Environmental Information</a>. 
* Plot precipitation data in R. 
* Publish & share an interactive plot of the data using Plotly. 
* Subset data by date (if completing Additional Resources code).
* Set a NoData Value to NA in R (if completing Additional Resources code). 

## Things You&rsquo;ll Need To Complete This Lesson
Please be sure you have the most current version of R and, preferably,
RStudio to write your code.

### R Libraries to Install:

* **ggplot2:** install.packages(&ldquo;ggplot2&rdquo;)
* **plotly:** install.packages(&ldquo;plotly&rdquo;)


### Data to Download 

Part of this lesson is to access and download the data directly from NOAA&rsquo;s 
National Climate Divisional Database. If instead you would prefer to download the data as a single compressed file, it can be downloaded from the 
<a href="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/6780978"> NEON Data Skills account on FigShare</a>.


**Set Working Directory** This lesson assumes that you have set your working 
directory to the location of the downloaded and unzipped data subsets. 

<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/set-working-directory-r" target="_blank"> An overview
of setting the working directory in R can be found here.</a>

**R Script & Challenge Code:** NEON data lessons often contain challenges that reinforce learned skills. If available, the code for challenge solutions is found in the downloadable R script of the entire lesson, available in the footer of each lesson page.

<h2>Research Question</h2>

<p>What were the patterns of precipitation leading up to the 2013 flooding events
in Colorado? </p>

<h2>Precipitation Data</h2>

<p>The heavy <strong>precipitation (rain)</strong> that occurred in September 2013 caused much 
damage during the 2013 flood by, among other things, increasing 
<strong>stream discharge (flow)</strong>. In this lesson we will download, explore, and 
visualize the precipitation data collected during this time to better understand 
this important flood driver.</p>

<h2>Where can we get precipitation data?</h2>

<p>The precipitation data are obtained through 
 <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">NOAA&#39;s National Centers for Environmental Information</a> 
(formerly the National Climatic Data Center). There are numerous climatic 
datasets that can be found and downloaded via the 
<a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search" target="_blank">Climate Data Online Search portal</a>. </p>

<p>The precipitation data that we will use is from the 
<a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/cooperative-observer-network-coop" target="_blank">Cooperative Observer Network (COOP)</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Through the National Weather Service (NWS) Cooperative Observer Program
(COOP), more than 10,000 volunteers take daily weather observations at National 
Parks, seashores, mountaintops, and farms as well as in urban and suburban 
areas. COOP data usually consist of daily maximum and minimum temperatures, 
snowfall, and 24-hour precipitation totals.</em>&rdquo; 
Quoted from NOAA&#39;s National Centers for Environmental Information</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Data are collected at different stations, often on paper data sheets like the 
one below, and then entered into a central database where we can access that data 
and download it in the .csv (Comma Separated Values) format.</p>

</figure></p>

<h2>Obtain the Data</h2>

<p>If you have not already opened the 
<a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search" target="_blank">Climate Data
Online Search portal</a>, do so now. </p>

<p>Note: If you are using the pre-compiled data subset that can be downloaded as a 
compressed file above, you should still read through this section to know where 
the data comes from before proceeding with the lesson. </p>

<h4>Step 1: Search for the data</h4>

<p>To obtain data we must first choose a location of interest. 
The COOP site Boulder 2 (Station ID:050843) is centrally located in Boulder, CO. </p>

<p><figure>
   <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/disturb-events-co13/LocationOfPrecipStation.png">
   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/disturb-events-co13/LocationOfPrecipStation.png"
   alt = " Map dislaying Cooperative Observer Network station 050843, located in central Boulder, CO. >
   </a>
   <figcaption> Cooperative Observer Network station 050843 is located in 
   central Boulder, CO. Source: National Centers for Environmental Information 
   </figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>Then we must decide what type of data we want to download for that station. As 
shown in the image below, we selected:</p>

<ul>
<li>the desired date range (1 January 2003 to 31 December 2013),</li>
<li>the type of dataset (&ldquo;Precipitation Hourly&rdquo;),</li>
<li>the search type (&ldquo;Stations&rdquo;) and </li>
<li><p>the search term (e.g. the # for the station located in central Boulder, CO: 050843). </p>

<figure>
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/disturb-events-co13/NCEI_DownloadData_ScreenShot.png">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/disturb-events-co13/NCEI_DownloadData_ScreenShot.png"
alt = " Data search interface of the selected Boulder, CO site, which allows the user to select the Weather Observation Type/Dataset, date range, and station identifier.">
</a>
<figcaption> Climate Data Online search page for the central Boulder, CO, station:050843
</figcaption>
</figure></li>
</ul>

<p>Once the data are entered and you select <code>Search</code>, you will be directed to a 
new page with a map. You can find out more information about the data by selecting
<code>View Full Details</code>. 
Notice that this dataset goes all the way back to 1 August 1948! However, we&#39;ve 
selected only a portion of this time frame. </p>

<h4>Step 2: Request the data</h4>

<p>Once you are sure this is the data that you want, you need to request it by 
selecting <code>Add to Cart</code>. The data can then be downloaded as a <strong>.csv</strong> file 
which we will use to conduct our analyses. Be sure to double check the date 
range before downloading. </p>

<p>On the options page, we want to make sure we select: </p>

<ul>
<li>Station Name</li>
<li>Geographic Location (this gives us longitude &amp; latitude; optional)</li>
<li>Include Data Flags (this gives us information if the data are problematic)</li>
<li>Units (Standard)</li>
<li>Precipitation (w/ HPCP automatically checked)</li>
</ul>

<p>On the next page you must enter an email address for the dataset to be sent 
to.  </p>

<h3>Step 3: Get the data</h3>

<p>As this is a small dataset, it won&#39;t take long for you to get an email telling 
you the dataset is ready. Follow the link in the email to download your dataset.
You can also view documentation (metadata) for the data.<br/>
Each data subset is downloaded with a unique order number.  The order number in 
our example dataset is 805325.  If you are using a dataset you&#39;ve downloaded 
yourself, make sure to substitute in your own order number in the code below. </p>

<p>To ensure that we remember what our data file is, we&#39;ve added a descriptor to 
the order number: <code>805325-precip_daily_2003-2013</code>. You may wish to do the same. </p>

<h1>Work with Precipitation Data</h1>

<h2>R Libraries</h2>

<p>We will use <code>ggplot2</code> to efficiently plot our data and <code>plotly</code> to create i
nteractive plots.</p>

<pre><code># load packages
library(ggplot2) # create efficient, professional plots
library(plotly) # create cool interactive plots


# set your working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import 
# and where we want to save our files. Be sure to move the download into 
# your working direectory!
wd &lt;- &quot;C:/Users/fsanchez/Documents/data/&quot; # This will depend on your local environment
setwd(wd)
</code></pre>

<h2>Import Precipitation Data</h2>

<p>We will use the <code>805325-Preciptation_daily_2003-2013.csv</code> file
in this analysis. This dataset is the daily precipitation date from the COOP 
station 050843 in Boulder, CO for 1 January 2003 through 31 December 2013. </p>

<p>Since the data format is a .csv, we can use <code>read.csv</code> to import the data. After
we import the data, we can take a look at the first few lines using <code>head()</code>, 
which defaults to the first 6 rows, of the <code>data.frame</code>. Finally, we can explore
the R object structure.</p>

<pre><code># import precip data into R data.frame by 
# defining the file name to be opened
precip.boulder &lt;- read.csv(paste0(wd,&quot;disturb-events-co13/precip/805325-precip_daily_2003-2013.csv&quot;), stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE )


# view first 6 lines of the data
head(precip.boulder)

</code></pre>

<h2>About the Data</h2>

<p>Viewing the structure of these data, we can see that different types of data are included in 
this file. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>STATION</strong> and <strong>STATION_NAME</strong>: Identification of the COOP station.</li>
<li><strong>ELEVATION, LATITUDE</strong> and <strong>LONGITUDE</strong>: The spatial location of the station.</li>
<li><strong>DATE</strong>: Gives the date in the format: YYYYMMDD HH:MM. Notice that DATE is 
currently class <code>chr</code>, meaning the data are interpreted as a character class and 
not as a date. </li>
<li><strong>HPCP</strong>: The total precipitation given in inches 
(since we selected <code>Standard</code> for the units), recorded
for the hour ending at the time specified by DATE. Importantly, the metadata 
(see below) notes that the value 999.99 indicates missing data. Also important, 
hours with no precipitation are not recorded.</li>
<li><strong>Measurement Flag</strong>: Indicates if there are any abnormalities with the 
measurement of the data. Definitions of each flag can be found in Table 2 of the
documentation. </li>
<li><strong>Quality Flag</strong>: Indicates if there are any potential quality problems with 
the data. Definitions of each flag can be found in Table 3 of the documentation. </li>
</ul>

<p>Additional information about the data, known as metadata, is available in the 
<code>PRECIP_HLY_documentation.pdf</code> file that can be downloaded along with the data. 
(Note, as of Sept. 2016, there is a mismatch in the data downloaded and the
documentation. The differences are in the units and missing data value: 
inches/999.99 (standard) or millimeters/25399.75 (metric)).</p>

<h2>Clean the Data</h2>

<p>Before we can start plotting and working with the data we always need to check 
several important factors: </p>

<ul>
<li>data class: is R interpreting the data the way we expect it. The function 
<code>str()</code> is an important tools for this. </li>
<li>NoData Values: We need to know if our data contains a specific value that 
means &ldquo;data are missing&rdquo; and if this value has been assigned to NA in R. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Convert Date-Time</h3>

<p>As we&#39;ve noted, the date field is in a character class. We can convert it to a date/time
class that will allow R to correctly interpret the data and allow us to easily 
plot the data. We can convert it to a date/time class using <code>as.POSIXct()</code>. </p>

<pre><code># convert to date/time and retain as a new field
precip.boulder$DateTime &lt;- as.POSIXct(precip.boulder$DATE, 
                                  format=&quot;%Y%m%d %H:%M&quot;) 
                                  # date in the format: YearMonthDay Hour:Minute 

# double check structure
str(precip.boulder$DateTime)

##  POSIXct[1:1840], format: &quot;2003-01-01 01:00:00&quot; ...
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>For more information on date/time classes, see the NEON tutorial 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/dc-convert-date-time-POSIX-r" target="_blank"> <em>Dealing With Dates &amp; Times in R - as.Date, POSIXct, POSIXlt</em></a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>NoData Values</h3>

<p>We&#39;ve also learned that missing values, also known as NoData
values, are labelled with the placeholder <code>999.99</code>. Do we have any NoData values in our data? </p>

<pre><code># histogram - would allow us to see 999.99 NA values 
# or other &quot;weird&quot; values that might be NA if we didn&#39;t know the NA value
hist(precip.boulder$HPCP)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/tutorials/R/R-skills/Colorado-floods-data-visualization/COOP-NEIS-Precipitation-In-R/rfigs/no-data-values-hist-1.png" alt="Histogram displaying the frquency of total precipitation in inches for the recorded hour."/></p>

<p>Looking at the histogram, it looks like we have mostly low values (which makes sense) but a few values
up near 1000 &ndash; likely 999.99. We can assign these entries to be <code>NA</code>, the value that
R interprets as no data.  </p>

<pre><code># assing NoData values to NA
precip.boulder$HPCP[precip.boulder$HPCP==999.99] &lt;- NA 

# check that NA values were added; 
# we can do this by finding the sum of how many NA values there are
sum(is.na(precip.boulder))

## [1] 94
</code></pre>

<p>There are 94 NA values in our dataset. This is missing data. </p>

<h4>Questions:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Do we need to worry about the missing data?<br/></li>
<li>Could they affect our analyses?<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>This depends on what questions we are asking.  Here we are looking at 
general patterns in the data across 10 years. Since we have just over 3650 
days in our entire dataset, missing 94 probably won&#39;t affect the general trends
we are looking at.  </p>

<p>Can you think of a research question where we would need to be concerned about
the missing data? </p>

<h2>Plot Precipitation Data</h2>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve cleaned up the data, we can view it. To do this we will plot using 
<code>ggplot()</code> from the <code>ggplot2</code> package. </p>

<pre><code>#plot the data
precPlot_hourly &lt;- ggplot(data=precip.boulder,  # the data frame
      aes(DateTime, HPCP)) +   # the variables of interest
      geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) +   # create a bar graph
      xlab(&quot;Date&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Precipitation (Inches)&quot;) +  # label the x &amp; y axes
      ggtitle(&quot;Hourly Precipitation - Boulder Station\n 2003-2013&quot;)  # add a title

precPlot_hourly

## Warning: Removed 94 rows containing missing values
## (position_stack).
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/tutorials/R/R-skills/Colorado-floods-data-visualization/COOP-NEIS-Precipitation-In-R/rfigs/plot-precip-hourly-1.png" alt="Bar graph of Hourly Precipitation (Inches) for the Boulder station, 050843, spanning years 2003 - 2013. X-axis and Y-axis are Date and Precipitation in Inches, repectively."/></p>

<p>As we can see, plots of hourly date lead to very small numbers and is difficult
to represent all information on a figure. Hint: If you can&#39;t see any bars on your
plot you might need to zoom in on it. </p>

<p>Plots and comparison of daily precipitation would be easier to view. </p>

<h2>Plot Daily Precipitation</h2>

<p>There are several ways to aggregate the data. </p>

<h4>Daily Plots</h4>

<p>If you only want to view the data plotted by date you need to create a column
with only dates (no time) and then re-plot. </p>

<pre><code># convert DATE to a Date class 
# (this will strip the time, but that is saved in DateTime)
precip.boulder$DATE &lt;- as.Date(precip.boulder$DateTime, # convert to Date class
                                  format=&quot;%Y%m%d %H:%M&quot;) 
                                  #DATE in the format: YearMonthDay Hour:Minute 

# double check conversion
str(precip.boulder$DATE)

##  Date[1:1840], format: &quot;2003-01-01&quot; &quot;2003-02-01&quot; &quot;2003-02-03&quot; ...

precPlot_daily1 &lt;- ggplot(data=precip.boulder,  # the data frame
      aes(DATE, HPCP)) +   # the variables of interest
      geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) +   # create a bar graph
      xlab(&quot;Date&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Precipitation (Inches)&quot;) +  # label the x &amp; y axes
      ggtitle(&quot;Daily Precipitation - Boulder Station\n 2003-2013&quot;)  # add a title

precPlot_daily1

## Warning: Removed 94 rows containing missing values
## (position_stack).
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/tutorials/R/R-skills/Colorado-floods-data-visualization/COOP-NEIS-Precipitation-In-R/rfigs/daily-summaries-1.png" alt="Bar graph of Daily Precipitation (Inches) for the Boulder station, 050843, spanning years 2003 - 2013. X-axis and Y-axis are Date and Precipitation in Inches, repectively."/></p>

<p>R will automatically combine all data from the same day and plot it as one entry.  </p>

<h4>Daily Plots &amp; Data</h4>

<p>If you want to record the combined hourly data for each day, you need to create a new data frame to store the daily data. We can 
use the <code>aggregate()</code> function to combine all the hourly data into daily data. 
We will use the date class DATE field we created in the previous code for this. </p>

<pre><code># aggregate the Precipitation (PRECIP) data by DATE
precip.boulder_daily &lt;-aggregate(precip.boulder$HPCP,   # data to aggregate
    by=list(precip.boulder$DATE),  # variable to aggregate by
    FUN=sum,   # take the sum (total) of the precip
    na.rm=TRUE)  # if the are NA values ignore them
    # if this is FALSE any NA value will prevent a value be totalled

# view the results
head(precip.boulder_daily)

##      Group.1   x
## 1 2003-01-01 0.0
## 2 2003-02-01 0.0
## 3 2003-02-03 0.4
## 4 2003-02-05 0.2
## 5 2003-02-06 0.1
## 6 2003-02-07 0.1
</code></pre>

<p>So we now have daily data but the column names don&#39;t mean anything. We can 
give them meaningful names by using the <code>names()</code> function. Instead of naming the column of 
precipitation values with the original <code>HPCP</code>, let&#39;s call it <code>PRECIP</code>.</p>

<pre><code># rename the columns
names(precip.boulder_daily)[names(precip.boulder_daily)==&quot;Group.1&quot;] &lt;- &quot;DATE&quot;
names(precip.boulder_daily)[names(precip.boulder_daily)==&quot;x&quot;] &lt;- &quot;PRECIP&quot;

# double check rename
head(precip.boulder_daily)

##         DATE PRECIP
## 1 2003-01-01    0.0
## 2 2003-02-01    0.0
## 3 2003-02-03    0.4
## 4 2003-02-05    0.2
## 5 2003-02-06    0.1
## 6 2003-02-07    0.1
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can plot the daily data. </p>

<pre><code># plot daily data
precPlot_daily &lt;- ggplot(data=precip.boulder_daily,  # the data frame
      aes(DATE, PRECIP)) +   # the variables of interest
      geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) +   # create a bar graph
      xlab(&quot;Date&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Precipitation (Inches)&quot;) +  # label the x &amp; y axes
      ggtitle(&quot;Daily Precipitation - Boulder Station\n 2003-2013&quot;)  # add a title

<p>Compare this plot to the plot we created using the first method. Are they the same? </p>

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**R Tip:** This manipulation, or aggregation, of data
can also be done with the package plyr using the summarize() function.
</div>

<h2>Subset the Data</h2>

<p>Instead of looking at the data for the full decade, let&#39;s now focus on just the
2 months surrounding the flood on 11-15 September. We&#39;ll focus on the window from 15 
August to 15 October. </p>

<p>Just like aggregating, we can accomplish this by interacting with the larger plot through the graphical interface or 
by creating a subset of the data and protting it separately.</p>

<h4>Subset Within Plot</h4>

<p>To see only a subset of the larger plot, we can simply set limits for the 
scale on the x-axis with <code>scale_x_date()</code>. </p>

<pre><code># First, define the limits -- 2 months around the floods
limits &lt;- as.Date(c(&quot;2013-08-15&quot;, &quot;2013-10-15&quot;))

# Second, plot the data - Flood Time Period
precPlot_flood &lt;- ggplot(data=precip.boulder_daily,
      aes(DATE, PRECIP)) +
      geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) +
      scale_x_date(limits=limits) +
      xlab(&quot;Date&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Precipitation (Inches)&quot;) +
      ggtitle(&quot;Precipitation - Boulder Station\n August 15 - October 15, 2013&quot;)

precPlot_flood

### Challenge: Plot Precip for Boulder Station Since 1948

The Boulder precipitation station has been recording data since 1948. Use the 
steps above to create a plot of the full record of precipitation at this station (1948 - 2013).
The full dataset takes considerable time to download, so we recommend you use the dataset provided in the compressed file (&ldquo;805333-precip_daily_1948-2013.csv&rdquo;). 

As an added challenge, aggregate the data by month instead of by day.

<h3>Units &amp; Scale</h3>

<p>If you are using a dataset downloaded before 2016, the units were in 
<strong>hundredths of an inch</strong>, this isn&#39;t the most useful measure. You might want to
create a new column <code>PRECIP</code> that contains the data from <code>HPCP</code> converted to 
inches.  </p>

<pre><code># convert from 100th inch by dividing by 100
precip.boulder$PRECIP&lt;-precip.boulder$HPCP/100

# view &amp; check to make sure conversion occurred
head(precip.boulder)
