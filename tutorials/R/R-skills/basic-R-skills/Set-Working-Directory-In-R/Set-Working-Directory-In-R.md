The primary goal of this tutorial is to explain how to set a working directory 
in R. The working directory is where your R session interacts with your hard drive. 
This is where you can read data that you want to use, and save new information such 
as derived data products, tables, maps, and figures. It is a good practice to store 
your information in an organized set of directories, so you will often want to change 
your working directory depending on what kinds of information that you need to access.
This tutorial teaches how to download and unzip the data files that accompany many 
NEON Data Skills tutorials, and also covers the concept of file paths. You can read 
from top to bottom, or use the menu bar at left to navigate to your desired topic.

## Set Up For NEON Data Skills Tutorials
Many NEON data tutorials utilize teaching data subsets which are hosted on the 
NEON Data Skills **figshare** repository. If a data subset is required for a 
tutorial it can be downloaded at the top of each tutorial in the **Download 
Data** section. 

Prior to working with any data in R, we must set the **working directory** to
the location of the data files. Setting the working directory tells R where 
the data files are located on the computer. If the working directory is not 
correctly set first, when we try to open a file we will get an error telling us 
that R cannot find the file. 

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** All NEON Data Skills tutorials are
written assuming the working directory is the parent directory to the 
uncompressed .zip file of downloaded data. This allows for multiple data 
subsets to be accessed in the tutorial without resetting the working directory. 
Generally, these tutorials have a default working directory of **~/Documents/data**. 
If you are working on a Mac, we suggest that you save your downloaded datasets 
in a directory with the same name and location so that you don't have to edit 
the code for the tutorial that you are working on. Most windows machines cannot 
use the tilde "~" notation, therefore you must define the working directory 
explicitly.</div>

* Wondering why we're saying **directory** instead of **folder**?  See our
 discussion of Directory vs. Folder in the middle of this tutorial. 

## Download & Uncompress the Data

#### 1) Download
First, we will download the data to a location on the computer. To download the 
data for this tutorial, click the blue button **Download NEON Teaching Data 
Subset: Meteorological Data for Harvard Forest** within the box at the 
top of this page. 

Note: In other NEON Data Skills tutorials, download all data subsets in the
**Download Data** section prior to starting the tutorial. Here, the second
data subset is for those wishing to practice these skills in a Challenge 
activity and will be downloaded at that time.

	 </figcaption>
</figure> 

After clicking on the **Download Data** button, the data will automatically 
download to the computer. 

#### 2) Locate .zip file
Second, we need to find the downloaded .zip file. Many browsers default to 
downloading to the **Downloads** directory on your computer. 
Note: You may have previously specified a specific directory (folder) for files
downloaded from the internet, if so, the .zip file will download there.

	 <figcaption> Screenshot of the computer's Downloads folder containing the
	 new <b>NEONDSMetTimeSeries.zip </b> file. Source: National Ecological
	 Observatory Network (NEON) 
	 </figcaption>
</figure> 

#### 3) Move to **data** directory
Third, we must move the data files to the location we want to work with them. 
We recommend moving the .zip to a dedicated **data** directory within the
**Documents** directory on your computer. This **data** directory can 
then be a repository for all data subsets you use for the NEON Data Skills 
tutorials. Note: If you chose  to store your data in a different directory 
(e.g., not in **~/Documents/data**), modify the directions below with the 
appropriate file path to your **data** directory. 

#### 4) Unzip/uncompress
Fourth, we need to unzip/uncompress the file so that the data files can be 
accessed. Use your favorite tool that can unpackage/open .zip files (e.g.,
winzip, Archive Utility, etc). The files will now be accessible in a directory 
named `NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series` containing all the subdirectories and files that 
make up the dataset or the subdirectories and files will be unzipped directly 
into the data directory. If the latter happens, they need to be moved into a 
`data/NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series` directory.

### Challenge: Download and Unzip Teaching Data Subset
Want to make sure you have these steps down! Prepare the 
**Site Layout Shapefiles Teaching Data Subset** so that the files
are accessible and ready to be opened in R. 
</div>


The directory should be the same as in this screenshot (below). Note that 
`NEON-DS-Site-Lyout-Files` directory will only be in your directory if you 
completed the challenge above. If you did not, your directory should look the 
same but without that directory.

## Directory vs. Folder

"Directory" and "Folder" both refer to the same thing. Folder makes a lot of 
sense when we think of an isolated folder as a "bin" containing many files. 
However, the analogy to a physical file folder falters when we start thinking 
about the relationship between different folders and how we tell a computer to 
find a specific folder. This is why the term directory is often preferred. Any 
directory (folder) can hold other directories and/or files. When we set the 
*working directory*, we are telling the computer the location of the directory 
(or folder) to start with when looking for other files or directories, or to 
save any output to. 


## Full, Base, and Relative Paths

The data downloaded and unzipped in the previous steps are located within a 
nested set of directories: 
 
 * primary-level/home directory: **neon**
	+ This directory isn't obvious as we are within this directory once we log
	into the computer. 
	+ You will see your own user ID.
 * secondary-level directory:   **neon/Documents**
 * tertiary-level directory: 	**neon/Documents/data**
 * quaternary-level directory:  **neon/Documents/data/NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series**
 * quaternary-level directory:  **neon/Documents/data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Shapefiles** 

### Full & Base Path
The **full path** is essentially the complete "directions" for how to find the 
desired directory or file. It **always** starts with the home directory or root
(e.g., `/Users/neon/`). A full path is the **base path** when used to set 
the working directory to a specific directory. The base path for the
 `NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series` directory would be:

	 /Users/neon/Documents/data/NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series 

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** File or directory paths and the home 
directory will appear slightly different in different operating systems. 
Linux will appear as
 `/home/neon/`. Windows will be similar to `C:\Documents and Settings\neon\` or
 `C:\Users\neon\`. The format varies by Windows version. Make special note of 
the direction of the slashes. Mac OS X and Unix format will appear as
 `/Users/neon/`. This tutorial will show Mac OS X output unless specifically
noted. 
</div>

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
### Challenge: Full File Path
Write out the full path for the `NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Shapefiles` directory. Use
the format of the operating system you are currently using.

Tip: When typing in the Rstudio console or an R script, if you surround your 
filepath with quotes you can take advantage of the 'tab-completion' feature. 
To use this feature, begin typing your filepath (e.g., "~/" or "C:") and then hit the tab button, which should pop up a list of possible directories and files that you could be pointing to. This method is awesome for avoiding typos in complex or long filepaths!

Bonus Points: Write the path as for one of the other operating systems. 
</div>

### Relative Path
A relative path is a path to a directory or file that starts from the
location determined by the working directory. If our working directory is set
to the **data** directory,

	 /Users/neon/Documents/data/

we can then create a relative path for all directories and files within the
**data** directory.

</figure>

The relative path for the `meanNDVI_HARV_2011.csv` file would be: 

	 NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series/HARV/NDVI/meanNDVI_HARV_2011.csv

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
### Challenge: Relative File Path
Use the format of your current operating system:

1. Write out the **full path** to for the `Boundary-US-State-Mass.shp` file. 
2. Write out the **relative path** for the `Boundary-US-State-Mass.shp` file
assuming that the working directory is set to `/Users/neon/Documents/data/`. 

Bonus: Write the paths as for one of the other operating systems. 
</div>


## The R Working Directory
In R, the working directory is the directory where R starts when looking for 
any file to open (as directed by a file path) and where it saves any output. 

Without a working directory all R scripts would need the full file path 
written any time we wanted to open or save a file. It is more efficient if we 
have a **base file path** set as our **working directory** and then all file 
paths written in our scripts only consist of the file path relative to that base
 path (a **relative path**). 

* If you are unfamiliar with the term **full path**, **base path**, or 
**relative path**, please see the section below on *Full, Base, and Relative Paths*
for a more detailed explanation before continuing with this tutorial.  

### Find a Full Path to a File in Unknown Location
If you are unsure of the path to a specific directory or file, you can 
find this information for a particular file/directory of interest by looking in 
the:

* Windows: **Properties**, General tab (right click on the file/directory) or 
in the file path bar at the top of each window (select versions). 
* Mac OS X: **Get Info** (right clicking/control+click on the file/directory)

The file path may appear as: 

Computer > Users > neon > Documents > data > NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series

Copy and paste this information to automatically reformat into the full 
path to the directory or file: 

* Windows:  `C:\Users\neon\Documents\data\NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series`
* Mac OS X:  `/Users/neon/Documents/data/NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series`

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** File or directory paths and the home 
directory will appear slightly different in different operating systems. 
Linux will appear as
 `/home/neon/`. Windows will be similar to `C:\Documents and Settings\neon\` or
 `C:\Users\neon\`. The format varies by Windows version. Make special note of 
the direction of the slashes. Mac OS X and Unix format will appear as
 `/Users/neon/`. This tutorial will show Mac OSX output unless specifically
noted. 
</div>

### Determine Current Working Directory
Once we are in the R program, we can view the current working directory
using the code `getwd()`. 

	# view current working directory 
	getwd()
	[1] "/Users/neon"

The working directory is currently set to the home directory `/Users/neon`. 
Remember, your current working directory will have a different user name and may
appear different based on operating system. 

This code can be used at any time to determine the current working directory. 

## Set the Working Directory
To set our current working directory to the location where our data are located,
we can either set the working directory in the R script or use our current GUI
to select the working directory.

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** All NEON Data Skills tutorials are
written assuming the working directory is the parent directory to the downloaded
data (the **data** directory in this tutorial). This allows for multiple data 
subsets to be accessed in the tutorial without resetting the working directory. 
</div> 

We want to set our working directory to the **data** directory.

### Set the Working Directory: Base Path in Script
We can set the working directory using the code `setwd("PATH")` where PATH is 
the full path to the desired directory. You can enter "PATH" as a string (as 
shown below), or save the file path as a string to a variable (e.g., 
`wd <- "~/Documents/data"`) and then set the working directory based on 
that variable (e.g., `setwd(wd)`).

This latter method is used in many of the NEON Data Skills tutorials because 
of the advantages that this method provides. First, this method is extermely 
flexible across different compute environments and formats, including personal 
computers, Linux-based servers on 'the cloud' (e.g., AWS, CyVerse), and when using 
Rmarkdown (.Rmd) documents. Second this method allows the tutorial's 
user to set their working directory once as a string and then to reuse that 
string as needed to reference input files, or make output files. For example, 
some functions must have a full filepath to an input file (such as when reading 
in HDF5 files). Third, this method simplifies the process that NEON uses internally 
to create and update these tutorials. All in all, saving the working 
directory as a string variable makes the code more explicit and determanistic without 
relying on working knowledge of relative filepaths, making your code more 
producible and easier for an outsider to interpret.

To practice, use these techniques to set your working directory to the directory where 
you have the data saved, and check that you set the working directory correctly. 
There is no R output from `setwd()`. If we want to check 
that the working directory is correctly set we can use `getwd()`.

#### Example Windows File Path
Notice the the backslashes used in Windows paths must be changed to slashes in
R. 

	# set the working directory to `data` folder
	wd <- "C:/Users/neon/Documents/data"
	setwd(wd)

	# check to ensure path is correct
	getwd()
	[1] "C:/Users/neon/Documents/data"

#### Example Mac OS X File Path
	# set the working directory to `data` folder
	wd <- "/Users/neon/Documents/data"
	setwd(wd)

	# check to ensure path is correct
	getwd()
	[1] "/Users/neon/Documents/data"

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** If using RStudio, you can view the 
contents of the working directory in the Files pane.

### Set the Working Directory: Using RStudio GUI
You can also set the working directory using the Rstudio and/or R graphical user interface (GUI). 
This method is easy for beginners to learn, but it also makes your code less 
reproducible because it relies on a person to follow certain instructions, which 
is a process that introduces human error. It may also be impossible for an observer 
to determine where your input data are stored, which can make troubleshooting 
more difficult as well. Use this method when getting started, or when you will 
find it helpful to use a graphical user interface to navigate your files. 
Note that this method will run a single line `setwd()` command in the console 
when you select your working directory, so you can copy/paste that line into 
your script for future use!

1. Go to `Session` in menu bar,
2. select `Select Working Directory`,
3. select `Choose Directory`,
4. in the new window that appears, select the appropriate directory.
