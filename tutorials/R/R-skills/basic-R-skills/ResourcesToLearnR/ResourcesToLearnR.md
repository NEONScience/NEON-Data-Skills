There are myriad resources out there to learn programming in R. After linking to 
a tutorial on how to install R and RStudio on your computer, we then outline a 
few different paths to learn R basics depending on how you enjoy learning, and 
finally we include a few resources for intermediate and advanced learning. 

## Setting Up your Computer

Start out by installing R and, we recommend, RStudio, on your computer. RStudio 
is an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) for the R program.  It 
is optional, but recommended when working with R. Directions
for installing can be found within the tutorial  
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/setup-git-bash-rstudio" target="_blank">Install Git, Bash Shell, R & RStudio</a>. 
You will need administrator permissions on your computer. 


## Pathways to Learning the Basics of R

### In-person trainings
If you prefer to learn through in-person trainings, consider local workshops 
from The Carpentries Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry (generally ~$25 for a 
2-day workshop), courses offered by a local college or university (prices vary), 
or organize your colleagues to meet regularly to learn R together (free!). 

### Online interactive courses
If you prefer to learn in a semi-structured online environment, there are a wide 
variety of online courses for learning R including Data Camp, Coursera, edX, and 
Lynda.com. Many of these options include free introductory lessons or trial 
periods as well as paid courses. We do not have personal experience with 
these courses and do not recommend or specifically promote any course.  

### In program interactive course

<a href="http://swirlstats.com/students.html" target="_blank">Swirl</a> 
is guided introduction to R where you code along with the instructions in R. You 
get direct feedback when you type a command incorrectly. To use this package, 
once you have R or RStudio open and running, use the following commands to start 
the first lesson. 

`install.packages("swirl")`

`library(swirl)`

`swirl()`

### Online tutorials
If you prefer a less structured online environment, these tutorial series may be 
better suited for you. 

* <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/" target="_blank"> Software Carpentry’s Programming with R</a>
  - Learn R with a focus on tools needed for effective programming. Beyond the 
  basics, it covers functions, loops, command line, and other key skills
* <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/" target="_blank"> Data Carpentry’s R for data analysis and visualization of Ecological Data</a> 
  - Learn R with a focus on data analysis. Beyond the basics, it covers dyplr for 
  data aggregation & manipulation, ggplot2 for plotting, and touches on 
  interacting with an SQL database. Designed to be taught by an instructor but the 
  materials also work for independent learning online.
* <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/" target="_blank">Ethan White’s Data Carpentry for Biologists Semester Course (online content)</a> 
  - This comprehensive course contains an R section. While the overall focus is on 
  data science skills, learning R is a portion of it (note, this is an extensive 
  course).
* <a href="https://education.rstudio.com/learn/" target="_blank">RStudio’s list</a>
  - RStudio links to many other learning opportunities. Start with the 'Beginners' 
  learning path.  

### Video tutorials
A blend of having an instructor and self-paced, video tutorials may also be of 
interest.  New stand-alone video tutorials are out each day, so we aren’t going 
to recommend a specific series.  Find what works for you by searching 
“R Programming video tutorials” on YouTube.  

### Books

Books are still a great way to learn R (and other languages). Many books are 
available at local libraries (university or community) or online, if you want to 
try them out before buying. Below are a few of the many, many books that data 
scientists working on the NEON project have found useful.

* Michael Crawley’s <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+R+Book%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780470973929" target="_blank">The R Book</a> 
is a classic that takes you from beginning steps to analyses and modelling. 
* Grolemun and Wickham’s <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/" target="_blank">R for Data Science </a>
focuses on using R in data science applications using Hadley Wickham’s 
“tidyverse”. It does assume some basic familiarity with R.  Bonus: it is available 
online or in book format! 
(If you are completely new, they recommend starting with 
<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028574.do" target="_blank"> Hands-on Programming with R</a>). 

## Beyond the Basics

There are many intermediate and advanced courses, lessons, and tutorials linked 
in the above resources. For example, the Swirl package offers intermediate and 
advanced courses on specific topics, as does RStudio's list. See courses here; 
development is ongoing so new courses may be added.

However, once the basics are handled, you will find that much of your learning 
will happen through solving individual problems you encounter. To solve these 
problems, your favorite search engine is your friend. Paste the error (without 
specifics to your file/data) into the search menu and find answers from those 
who have had similar questions.

NEON data tutorials.
