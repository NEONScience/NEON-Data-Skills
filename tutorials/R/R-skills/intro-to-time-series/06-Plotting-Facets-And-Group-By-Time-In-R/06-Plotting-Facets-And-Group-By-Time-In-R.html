<h2>Plot Data Subsets Using Facets</h2>

<p>In this tutorial we will learn how to create a panel of individual plots - known
as facets in <code>ggplot2</code>. Each plot represents a particular <code>data_frame</code>
time-series subset, for example a year or a season.</p>

<h3>Load the Data</h3>

<p>We will use the daily micro-meteorology data for 2009-2011 from the Harvard
Forest. If you do not have this data loaded into an R <code>data_frame</code>, please 
load them and convert date-time columns to a <code>date-time class</code> now.</p>

<pre><code># Remember it is good coding technique to add additional libraries to the top of
# your script 
library(lubridate) # for working with dates
library(ggplot2)  # for creating graphs
library(scales)   # to access breaks/formatting functions
library(gridExtra) # for arranging plots
library(grid)   # for arranging plots
library(dplyr)  # for subsetting by season

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import
wd &lt;- &quot;~/Documents/&quot;

# daily HARV met data, 2009-2011

<h2>ggplot2 Facets</h2>

<p>Facets allow us to plot subsets of data in one cleanly organized panel. We use
<code>facet_grid()</code> to create a plot of a particular <strong>variable</strong> subsetted by a
particular <strong>group</strong>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s plot air temperature as we did previously. We will name the <code>ggplot</code>
object <code>AirTempDaily</code>.</p>

<pre><code>AirTempDaily &lt;- ggplot(harMetDaily.09.11, aes(date, airt)) +
           geom_point() +
           ggtitle(&quot;Daily Air Temperature\n NEON Harvard Forest\n 2009-2011&quot;) +
           xlab(&quot;Date&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Temperature (C)&quot;) +
           scale_x_date(labels=date_format (&quot;%m-%y&quot;))+
           theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face=&quot;bold&quot;,
                 size = 20)) +
           theme(text = element_text(size=18))

AirTempDaily
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/R-skills/intro-to-time-series/06-Plotting-Facets-And-Group-By-Time-In-R/rfigs/plot-airt-1.png" alt="A scatterplot showing the relationship between time and daily air temperature at Harvard Forest between 2009 and 2011. Plot title, font, axis scale and axis labels have been specified by the user."/></p>

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** If you are working with a date & time
class (e.g. POSIXct), you can use scale_x_datetime instead of scale_x_date.
</div>

<p>This plot tells us a lot about the annual increase and decrease of temperature
at the NEON Harvard Forest field site. However, what if we want to plot each
year&#39;s worth of data individually?</p>

<p>We can use the <code>facet()</code> element in <code>ggplot</code> to create facets or a panel of 
plots that are grouped by a particular category or time period. To create a 
plot for each year, we will first need a <strong>year</strong> column in our data to use as a
subset factor. We created a year column using the <code>year</code> function in the 
<code>lubridate</code> package in the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/time-series-subset-dplyr" target="_blank"><em>Subset and Manipulate Time Series Data with dplyr</em> tutorial</a>.</p>

<pre><code># add year column to daily values
harMetDaily.09.11$year &lt;- year(harMetDaily.09.11$date)

# view year column head and tail
head(harMetDaily.09.11$year)

## [1] 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009

tail(harMetDaily.09.11$year)

## [1] 2011 2011 2011 2011 2011 2011
</code></pre>

<h2>Facet by Year</h2>

<p>Once we have a column that can be used to group or subset our data, we can 
create a faceted plot - plotting each year&#39;s worth of data in an individual, 
labelled panel.</p>

<pre><code># run this code to plot the same plot as before but with one plot per season
AirTempDaily + facet_grid(. ~ year)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/R-skills/intro-to-time-series/06-Plotting-Facets-And-Group-By-Time-In-R/rfigs/plot-facet-year-1.png" alt=" "/></p>

<p>Oops - what happened? The plot did not render because we added the <code>year</code> column
after creating the <code>ggplot</code> object <code>AirTempDaily</code>. Let&#39;s rerun the plotting code
to ensure our newly added column is recognized.</p>

<pre><code>AirTempDaily &lt;- ggplot(harMetDaily.09.11, aes(date, airt)) +
           geom_point() +
           ggtitle(&quot;Daily Air Temperature\n NEON Harvard Forest&quot;) +
            xlab(&quot;Date&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Temperature (C)&quot;) +
            scale_x_date(labels=date_format (&quot;%m-%y&quot;))+
           theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face=&quot;bold&quot;,
                 size = 20)) +
           theme(text = element_text(size=18))

# facet plot by year
AirTempDaily + facet_grid(. ~ year)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/R-skills/intro-to-time-series/06-Plotting-Facets-And-Group-By-Time-In-R/rfigs/plot-facet-year-2-1.png" alt="A three-panel scatterplot showing the relationship between time and daily air temperature at Harvard Forest between 2009 and 2011. Left Panel: 2009. Center Panel: 2010. Right Panel: 2011. Notice each subplot has the time axis scale, covering the whole period 2009 - 2011. Plot titles, fonts, axis scales and axes labels have been specified by the user."/></p>

<p>The faceted plot is interesting, however the x-axis on each plot is formatted
as: month-day-year starting in 2009 and ending in 2011. This means that the data
for 2009 is on the left end of the x-axis and the data for 2011 is on the right 
end of the x-axis of the 2011 plot. </p>

<p>Our plots would be easier to visually compare if the days were formatted in 
Julian or year days rather than date. We have Julian days stored in our
<code>data_frame</code> (<code>harMetDaily.09.11</code>) as <code>jd</code>.</p>

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** If you are unfamiliar with Julian day or
year day, see the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/julian-day-conversion-r)" target="_blank">Convert to Julian Day tutorial </a>.
</div>

<pre><code>AirTempDaily_jd &lt;- ggplot(harMetDaily.09.11, aes(jd, airt)) +
           geom_point() +
           ggtitle(&quot;Air Temperature\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site&quot;) +
           xlab(&quot;Julian Day&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Temperature (C)&quot;) +
           theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face=&quot;bold&quot;,
                 size = 20)) +
           theme(text = element_text(size=18))

# create faceted panel
AirTempDaily_jd + facet_grid(. ~ year)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/R-skills/intro-to-time-series/06-Plotting-Facets-And-Group-By-Time-In-R/rfigs/plot-precip-jd-1.png" alt="A three-panel scatterplot showing the relationship between julian-date and daily air temperature at Harvard Forest between 2009 and 2011. Left Panel: 2009. Center Panel: 2010. Right Panel: 2011. Plot titles, fonts, axis scales and axes labels have been specified by the user."/></p>

<p>Using Julian day, our plots are easier to visually compare. Arranging our plots 
this way, side by side, allows us to quickly scan for differences along the
y-axis. Notice any differences in min vs max air temperature across the three
years?</p>

<h2>Arrange Facets</h2>

<p>We can rearrange the facets in different ways, too.</p>

<pre><code># move labels to the RIGHT and stack all plots
AirTempDaily_jd + facet_grid(year ~ .)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/R-skills/intro-to-time-series/06-Plotting-Facets-And-Group-By-Time-In-R/rfigs/rearrange-facets-1.png" alt="A three-panel scatterplot showing the relationship between julian-date and daily air temperature at Harvard Forest between 2009 and 2011. Top Panel: 2009. Middle Panel: 2010. Bottom Panel: 2011. Plot titles, fonts, axis scales and axes labels have been specified by the user."/></p>

<p>If we use <code>facet_wrap</code> we can specify the number of columns.</p>

<pre><code># display in two columns
AirTempDaily_jd + facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 2)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/R-skills/intro-to-time-series/06-Plotting-Facets-And-Group-By-Time-In-R/rfigs/rearrange-facets-columns-1.png" alt="A multi-panel scatterplot showing the relationship between julian-date and daily air temperature at Harvard Forest between 2009 and 2011. Top Left Panel: 2009. Top Right Panel: 2010. Bottom Left Panel: 2011. Bottom Right Panel: Blank. Plot titles, fonts, axis scales and axes labels have been specified by the user."/></p>

<h2>Graph Two Variables on One Plot</h2>

<p>Next, let&#39;s explore the relationship between two variables - air temperature
and soil temperature. We might expect soil temperature to fluctuate with changes
in air temperature over time.  </p>

<p>We will use <code>ggplot()</code> to plot <code>airt</code> and <code>s10t</code> (soil temperature 10 cm below
the ground). </p>

<pre><code>airSoilTemp_Plot &lt;- ggplot(harMetDaily.09.11, aes(airt, s10t)) +
           geom_point() +
           ggtitle(&quot;Air vs. Soil Temperature\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n 2009-2011&quot;) +
           xlab(&quot;Air Temperature (C)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Soil Temperature (C)&quot;) +
           theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face=&quot;bold&quot;,
                 size = 20)) +
           theme(text = element_text(size=18))

airSoilTemp_Plot
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/R-skills/intro-to-time-series/06-Plotting-Facets-And-Group-By-Time-In-R/rfigs/plot-airt-soilt-1.png" alt="A scatterplot showing the relationship between daily air temperature and daily soil temperature at Harvard Forest between 2009 and 2011. Plot titles, fonts, axis scales and axes labels have been specified by the user."/></p>

<p>The plot above suggests a relationship between the air and soil temperature as
we might expect. However, it clumps all three years worth of data into one plot.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s create a stacked faceted plot of air vs. soil temperature grouped by year.</p>

<p>Lucky for us, we can do this quickly with one line of code while reusing the
plot we created above.</p>

<pre><code># create faceted panel
airSoilTemp_Plot + facet_grid(year ~ .)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/R-skills/intro-to-time-series/06-Plotting-Facets-And-Group-By-Time-In-R/rfigs/faceted-temp-plots-1.png" alt="A three-panel scatterplot showing the relationship between daily air temperature and daily soil temperature at Harvard Forest between 2009 and 2011. Top Panel: 2009. Middle Panel: 2010. Bottom Panel: 2011. Plot titles, fonts, axis scales and axes labels have been specified by the user."/></p>

<p>Have a close look at the data. Are there any noticeable min/max temperature 
differences between the three years?</p>

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
### Challenge: Faceted Plot

Create a faceted plot of air temperature vs soil temperature by *month* rather 
than year.

HINT: To create this plot, you will want to add a month column to our
data_frame. We can use lubridate month in the same way we used year to add
a year column. 

</div>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/R-skills/intro-to-time-series/06-Plotting-Facets-And-Group-By-Time-In-R/rfigs/challenge-answer-temp-month-1.png" alt="A multi-panel scatterplot showing the relationship between daily air temperature and daily soil temperature according to month at Harvard Forest between 2009 and 2011. Panels run left-to-right, top-to-bottom, starting with January in top-left position. Plot titles, fonts, axis scales and axes labels have been specified by the user."/></p>

<h2>Faceted Plots &amp; Categorical Groups</h2>

<p>In the challenge above, we grouped our data by <em>month</em> - specified by a numeric
value between 1 (January) and 12 (December). However, what if we wanted to 
organize our plots using a categorical (character) group such as month name?
Let&#39;s do that next.</p>

<p>If we want to group our data by month <em>name</em>, we first need to create a month
name column in our <code>data_frame</code>. We can create this column using the following
syntax:</p>

<p><code>format(harMetDaily.09.11$date,&quot;%B&quot;)</code>, </p>

<p>which tells R to extract the month name (<code>%B</code>) from the date field.</p>

<pre><code># add text month name column
harMetDaily.09.11$month_name &lt;- format(harMetDaily.09.11$date,&quot;%B&quot;)

# view head and tail
head(harMetDaily.09.11$month_name)

## [1] &quot;January&quot; &quot;January&quot; &quot;January&quot; &quot;January&quot; &quot;January&quot; &quot;January&quot;

tail(harMetDaily.09.11$month_name)

## [1] &quot;December&quot; &quot;December&quot; &quot;December&quot; &quot;December&quot; &quot;December&quot; &quot;December&quot;

# recreate plot
airSoilTemp_Plot &lt;- ggplot(harMetDaily.09.11, aes(airt, s10t)) +
           geom_point() +
           ggtitle(&quot;Air vs. Soil Temperature \n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n 2009-2011&quot;) +
            xlab(&quot;Air Temperature (C)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Soil Temperature (C)&quot;) +
           theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face=&quot;bold&quot;,
                 size = 20)) +
           theme(text = element_text(size=18))

# create faceted panel
airSoilTemp_Plot + facet_wrap(~month_name, nc=3)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/R-skills/intro-to-time-series/06-Plotting-Facets-And-Group-By-Time-In-R/rfigs/extract-month-name-1.png" alt="A multi-panel scatterplot showing the relationship between daily air temperature and daily soil temperature according to month at Harvard Forest between 2009 and 2011. Notice panels are now placed in alphabetical order by month. Plot titles, fonts, axis scales and axes labels have been specified by the user."/></p>

<p>Great! We&#39;ve created a nice set of plots by month. However, how are the plots 
ordered? It looks like R is ordering things alphabetically, yet we know
that months are ordinal not character strings. To account for order, we can 
reassign the <code>month_name</code> field to a <code>factor</code>. This will allow us to specify
an order to each factor &ldquo;level&rdquo; (each month is a level).</p>

<p>The syntax for this operation is </p>

<ol>
<li>Turn field into a factor: <code>factor(fieldName)</code>.</li>
<li>Designate the <code>levels</code> using a list <code>c(level1, level2, level3)</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In our case, each level will be a month.</p>

<pre><code># order the factors
harMetDaily.09.11$month_name = factor(harMetDaily.09.11$month_name, 
                                      levels=c(&#39;January&#39;,&#39;February&#39;,&#39;March&#39;,
                                               &#39;April&#39;,&#39;May&#39;,&#39;June&#39;,&#39;July&#39;,
                                               &#39;August&#39;,&#39;September&#39;,&#39;October&#39;,
                                               &#39;November&#39;,&#39;December&#39;))
</code></pre>

<p>Once we have specified the factor column and its associated levels, we can plot 
again. Remember, that because we have modified a column in our <code>data_frame</code>, we
need to rerun our <code>ggplot</code> code.</p>

<pre><code># recreate plot
airSoilTemp_Plot &lt;- ggplot(harMetDaily.09.11, aes(airt, s10t)) +
           geom_point() +
           ggtitle(&quot;Air vs. Soil Temperature \n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n 2009-2011&quot;) +
            xlab(&quot;Air Temperature (C)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Soil Temperature (C)&quot;) +
           theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face=&quot;bold&quot;,
                 size = 20)) +
           theme(text = element_text(size=18))

# create faceted panel

<h2>Subset by Season - <em>Advanced Topic</em></h2>

<p>Sometimes we want to group data by custom time periods. For example, we might
want to group by season. However, the definition of various seasons may vary by 
region which means we need to manually define each time period.</p>

<p>In the next coding section, we will add a season column to our data using a
manually defined query. Our field site is Harvard Forest (Massachusetts),
located in the northeastern portion of the United States. Based on the climate
of this region, we can divide the year into 4 seasons as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li>Winter: December - February</li>
<li>Spring: March - May </li>
<li>Summer: June - August</li>
<li>Fall: September - November </li>
</ul>

<p>In order to subset the data by season we will use the <code>dplyr</code> package.  We
can use the numeric month column that we added to our data earlier in this
tutorial.</p>

<pre><code># add month to data_frame - note we already performed this step above.
harMetDaily.09.11$month  &lt;- month(harMetDaily.09.11$date)

# view head and tail of column
head(harMetDaily.09.11$month)

## [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1

tail(harMetDaily.09.11$month)

## [1] 12 12 12 12 12 12
</code></pre>

<p>We can use <code>mutate()</code> and a set of <code>ifelse</code> statements to create a new
categorical variable called <code>season</code> by grouping three months together. </p>

<p>Within <code>dplyr</code> <code>%in%</code> is short-hand for &ldquo;contained within&rdquo;. So the syntax</p>

<p><code>ifelse(month %in% c(12, 1, 2), &quot;Winter&quot;,</code></p>

<p>can be read as &ldquo;if the <code>month</code> column value is 12 or 1 or 2, then assign the
value &quot;Winter&rdquo;&ldquo;. </p>

<p>Our <code>ifelse</code> statement ends with</p>

<p><code>ifelse(month %in% c(9, 10, 11), &quot;Fall&quot;, &quot;Error&quot;)</code></p>

<p>which we can translate this as &quot;if the <code>month</code> column value is 9 or 10 or 11,
then assign the value &quot;Winter&rdquo;.&ldquo;</p>

<p>The last portion <code>, &quot;Error&quot;</code> tells R that if a <code>month</code> column value does not 
fall within any of the criteria laid out in previous <code>ifelse</code> statements, 
assign the column the value of &quot;Error&rdquo;. </p>

<pre><code>harMetDaily.09.11 &lt;- harMetDaily.09.11 %&gt;% 
  mutate(season = 
           ifelse(month %in% c(12, 1, 2), &quot;Winter&quot;,
           ifelse(month %in% c(3, 4, 5), &quot;Spring&quot;,
           ifelse(month %in% c(6, 7, 8), &quot;Summer&quot;,
           ifelse(month %in% c(9, 10, 11), &quot;Fall&quot;, &quot;Error&quot;)))))


# check to see if this worked
head(harMetDaily.09.11$month)

## [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1

head(harMetDaily.09.11$season)

## [1] &quot;Winter&quot; &quot;Winter&quot; &quot;Winter&quot; &quot;Winter&quot; &quot;Winter&quot; &quot;Winter&quot;

tail(harMetDaily.09.11$month)

## [1] 12 12 12 12 12 12

tail(harMetDaily.09.11$season)

## [1] &quot;Winter&quot; &quot;Winter&quot; &quot;Winter&quot; &quot;Winter&quot; &quot;Winter&quot; &quot;Winter&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have a season column, we can plot our data by season!</p>

<pre><code># recreate plot
airSoilTemp_Plot &lt;- ggplot(harMetDaily.09.11, aes(airt, s10t)) +
           geom_point() +
           ggtitle(&quot;Air vs. Soil Temperature\n 2009-2011\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site&quot;) +
            xlab(&quot;Air Temperature (C)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Soil Temperature (C)&quot;) +
           theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face=&quot;bold&quot;,
                 size = 20)) +
           theme(text = element_text(size=18))

# run this code to plot the same plot as before but with one plot per season
airSoilTemp_Plot + facet_grid(. ~ season)
</code></pre>

<p>Note, that once again, we re-ran our <code>ggplot</code> code to make sure our new column
is recognized by R. We can experiment with various facet layouts next.</p>

<pre><code># for a landscape orientation of the plots we change the order of arguments in
# facet_grid():
airSoilTemp_Plot + facet_grid(season ~ .)
</code></pre>

<p>Once again, R is arranging the plots in an alphabetical order not an order
relevant to the data. </p>

### Challenge: Create Plots by Season
The goal of this challenge is to create plots that show the relationship between
air and soil temperature across the different seasons with seasons arranged in
an ecologically meaningful order.  

1. Create a *factor* class season variable by converting the season column that
we just created to a factor, then organize the seasons chronologically as
follows: Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall. 

2. Create a new faceted plot that is 2 x 2 (2 columns of plots). HINT: One can
neatly plot multiple variables using facets as follows: 
facet_grid(variable1 ~ variable2). 

3. Create a plot of air vs soil temperature grouped by year and season.

<h2>Work with Year-Month Data: base R and zoo Package</h2>

<p>Some data will have month formatted in <code>Year-Month</code> 
(e.g. <code>met_monthly_HARV$date</code>). </p>

<p>(Note: You will load this file in the Challenge below)</p>

<pre><code>## Warning in file(file, &quot;rt&quot;): cannot open file &#39;/Users/olearyd/Documents/
## NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series/HARV/FisherTower-Met/hf001-04-monthly-m.csv&#39;: No
## such file or directory

## Error in file(file, &quot;rt&quot;): cannot open the connection

## Error in h(simpleError(msg, call)): error in evaluating the argument &#39;x&#39; in selecting a method for function &#39;head&#39;: object &#39;met_monthly_HARV&#39; not found
</code></pre>

<p>For many analyses, we might want to summarize this data into a yearly total. 
Base R does NOT have a distinct year-month date class. Instead to work with a 
year-month field using base R, we need to convert to a Date class, which 
necessitates adding an associated day value. The syntax would be:</p>

<p><code>as.Date(paste(met_monthly_HARV$date,&quot;-01&quot;, sep=&quot;&quot;))</code></p>

<p>The syntax above creates a <code>Date</code> column from the <code>met_montly_HARV$date</code> column.
We then add the arbitrary date - the first (<code>&quot;-01&quot;</code>). The final bit of code
(<code>sep=&quot;&quot;</code>) designates the character string used to separate the month, day,
and year portions of the returned string (in our case nothing, as we have 
included the hyphen with our inserted date value).</p>

<p>Alternatively, to work directly with a year-month data we could use the <code>zoo</code>
package and its included year-month date class - <code>as.yearmon</code>. With <code>zoo</code> the
syntax would be:</p>

<p><code>as.Date(as.yearmon(met_monthly_HARV$date))</code></p>

### Challenge: Convert Year-Month Data
The goal of this challenge is to use both the base R and the zoo package
methods for working with year-month data.  

Load the NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series/HARV/FisherTower-Met/hf001-04-monthly-m.csv
file and give it the name met_monthly_HARV. Then:

1. Convert the date field into a date/time class using both base R and the 
zoo package. Name the new fields date_base and ymon_zoo respectively.  
2. Look at the format and check the class of both new date fields.
3. Convert the ymon_zoo field into a new Date class field (date_zoo) so it
can be used in base R, ggplot, etc.  

HINT: be sure to load the zoo package, if you have not already.

<p>Do you prefer to use base R or <code>zoo</code> to convert these data to a date/time
class?</p>

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** zoo date/time classes cannot be used
directly with ggplot2. If you deal with date formats that make sense to
primarily use zoo date/time classes, you can use ggplot2 with the addition of 
other functions. For details see the
