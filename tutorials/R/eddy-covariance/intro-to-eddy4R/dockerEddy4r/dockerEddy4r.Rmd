This tutorial provides the basics on how to set up Docker on one's local computer
and then connect to an eddy4R Docker container in order to use the eddy4R R package. 
There are no specific skills needed for this tutorial, however, you will need to
know how to access the command line tool for your operating system 
(basic instructions given).

## Learning Objectives
After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

  * Access Docker on your local computer.
  * Access the eddy4R package in a RStudio Docker environment.
  
## Things You’ll Need To Complete This Tutorial

The directions on how to install docker are heavily borrowed from the author's 
of CyVerse's Container Camp's 
<a href="https://cyverse-container-camp-workshop-2018.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/docker/dockerintro.html" target="_blank"> Intro to Docker</a> and we thank them for providing the information. 

The directions for how to access eddy4R comes from 

Metzger, S., D. Durden, C. Sturtevant, H. Luo, N. Pingintha-durden, and T. Sachs (2017). eddy4R 0.2.0: a DevOps model for community-extensible processing and analysis of eddy-covariance data based on R, Git, Docker, and HDF5. Geoscientific Model Development 10:3189–3206. doi:

In the tutorial below, we give the very barest of information to get Docker set
up for use with the NEON R package eddy4R. For more information on using Docker, 
consider reading through the content from CyVerse's Container Camp's 
<a href="https://cyverse-container-camp-workshop-2018.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/docker/dockerintro.html" target="_blank"> Intro to Docker</a>. 


## Install Docker

To work with the eddy4R–Docker image, you first need to sign up for an 
account at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">DockerHub</a>. 

Once logged in, getting Docker up and running on your favorite operating system 
(Mac/Windows/Linux) is very easy. The "getting started" guide on Docker has 
detailed instructions for setting up Docker. Unless you plan on being a very
active user and devoloper in Docker, we recommend starting with the stable channel 
(not edge channel) as you may encounter fewer problems.  

* <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/" target="_blank">Mac </a>
* <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/" target="_blank">Windows </a>
* <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/" target="_blank">Linux</a>

If you're using Docker for Windows make sure you have 
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#shared-drives" target="_blank">shared your drive</a>. 

If you're using an older version of Windows or MacOS, you may need to use 
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/" target="_blank">Docker Machine</a> 
instead. 

## Test Docker installation

Once you are done installing Docker, test your Docker installation by running 
the following command to make sure you are using version 1.13 or higher. 

You will need an open shell window (Linux; Mac=Terminal) or the Docker 
Quickstart Terminal (Windows).

``` {bash docker-version, eval=FALSE}

docker --version
	
```

When run, you will see which version of Docker you are currently running.

Note: If you run just the word ``docker`` you should see a whole bunch of 
lines showing the different options available with ``docker``. Alternatively 
you can test your installation by running the following:

``` {bash docker-world, eval=FALSE}

docker run hello-world
```

Notice that the first line states that the image can't be found locally. The 
next few lines are pulling the image, so if you were to run the `hello-world` 
prompt again, it would already be local and you'd see the message start at 
"Hello from Docker!". 

If these steps work, you are ready to go on to access the 
eddy4R-Docker image that houses the suite of eddy4R R 
packages. If these steps have not worked, follow the installation 
instructions a second time. 

## Accessing eddy4R

Download of the eddy4R–Docker image and subsequent creation of a local container 
can be performed by two simple commands in an open shell (Linux; Mac = Terminal) 
or the Docker Quickstart Terminal (Windows). 

The first command `docker login` will prompt you for your DockerHub ID and password. 

The second command `docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=YOURPASSWORD stefanmet/eddy4r:1.0.0` will 
download the latest eddy4R–Docker image and start a Docker container that 
utilizes port 8787 for establishing a graphical interface via web browser.  

* `docker run`: docker will preform some process on an isolated container 
* `-d`: the container will start in a detached mode, which means the container 
run in the background and will print the container ID
* `-p`: publish a container to a specified port (which follows)
* `8787:8787`: specify which port you want to use. The default 8787:8787 
is great if you are running locally. The first 4 digits are the 
port on your machine, the last 4 digits are the port communicating with 
RStudio on Docker. You can change the first 4 digits if you want to use a 
different port on your machine, or if you are running many containers or 
are on a shared network, but the last 4 digits need to be 8787.
* `-e PASSWORD=YOURPASSWORD`: define a password environmental variable to use upon login to the Rstudio instance. YOURPASSWORD can be anything you want.
* `stefanmet/eddy4r:1.0.0`: finally, which container do you want to run. 

Now try it. 

```{bash get-eddy4R, eval=FALSE}
docker login 

docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=YOURPASSWORD stefanmet/eddy4r:1.0.0
```

This last command will run a specified release version (`eddy4r:1.0.0`) of the 
Docker image. Alternatively you can use `eddy4r:latest` to get the most up-to-date 
development image of eddy4r. 

If you are using data stored on your local machine, rather than cloud hosting, a 
physical file system location on the host computer (local/dir) can be mounted 
to a file system location inside the Docker container (docker/dir). This is 
achieved with the Docker run option `-v local/dir:docker/dir`.


## Access RStudio session

Now you can access the interactive RStudio session for using eddy4r by using any
web browser and going to `http://host-ip-address:8787` where `host-ip-address` 
is the internal IP address of the Docker host. For example, if your host IP address 
is 10.100.90.169 then you should type `http://10.100.90.169:8787` into your browser. 

To determine the IP address of your Docker host, follow the instructions below 
for your operating system.

***
#### Windows
Depending on the version of Docker, older Docker Toolbox versus the newer Docker Desktop for Windows, there are different way to get the docker machine IP address:
* Docker Toolbox - Type `docker-machine ip default` into cmd.exe window. The output will be your local IP address for the docker machine. 
* Docker Desktop for Windows - Type `ipconfig` into cmd.exe window. The output will include either DockerNAT IPv4 address or vEthernet IPv4 address that docker uses to communicate to the internet, which in most cases will be **10.0.75.1**. 


#### Mac

Type `ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1` into your Terminal window. 
The output will be one or more local IP addresses for the docker machine. Use 
the numbers after the first `inet` output. 

#### Linux
Type `localhost` in a shell session and the local IP will be the output.

***

Once in the web browser you can log into this instance of the RStudio session 
with the username as **rstudio** and password as defined by `YOURPASSWORD`. Once complete you are now in 
a RStudio user interface with eddy4R installed and ready to use.
