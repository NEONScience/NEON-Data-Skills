<p>THIS TUTORIAL USES PRE-PREPARED DATA PROVIDED IN PERSON. CHECK 
BACK FOR AN UPDATED TUTORIAL INCLUDING INSTRUCTIONS FOR DATA 
WRANGLING.</p>

<p>Flux footprints represent an estimate of the region of land surface 
contributing to the fluxes estimated by eddy covariance. The exact 
footprint varies from moment to moment, due to changes in wind 
speed and direction, so footprints are typically presented as 
proportional estimates of the contribution from each point over the 
relevant time period. See 
<a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.922.4124&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target="_blank">Amiro 1998</a> for details and considerations about 
footprint calculations.</p>

<p>Because they represent regions of land around the flux tower, flux 
footprints are ideally suited to be used in combination with remotely 
sensed data. In this tutorial, we attempt to use flux footprints 
together with NDVI to estimate net ecosystem exchange (NEE), but the 
general principles used here can be applied to many data types in the 
remote sensing and eddy covariance suites (for example, canopy water 
content and latent heat fluxes, canopy height increment and 
cumulative carbon uptake, etc).</p>

<h3>Background: NDVI in the flux footprint</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s say we want to use reflectance data to scale up NEE, by 
extrapolating flux data across a larger landscape.</p>

<p>NEON remote sensing flights follow a detailed schedule, as described 
on the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/flight-schedules-coverage" target="_blank">flight schedule page</a>. Although flights are generally 
carried out at a similar time of year at each site over time, weather 
conditions can shift the exact date, and local climate and phenology 
may result in flights capturing slightly different conditions on the 
ground in different years. And of course, local conditions each year 
may result in different vegetation and soil conditions even at the same 
time of year and same phenological stage.</p>

<p>The flux footprints enable us to greatly improve the accuracy of the 
relationship between reflectance and fluxes - instead of guessing at 
the appropriate region around the tower to use for the comparison, we 
can use the region identified by the footprint, and weighted by the 
relative contribution of each pixel to the footprint.</p>

<p>To begin to bring together these data sources, in this tutorial, we will 
examine the relationship between NDVI within the flux footprint and NEE 
on the day(s) the remote sensing flight took place. In order to give 
ourselves the best odds of detecting differences, we&#39;ll focus on 
grasslands, where NDVI is a more reliable indicator of photosynthetic 
activity than, say, evergreen forests. The sites used here span a<br/>
large latitude range across the Great Plains.</p>

<div id="ds-objectives" markdown="1">

<h2>Set Up Environment and Load Data</h2>

<p>First install and load the necessary packages.</p>

<pre><code>## 
## # install and load raster package
## # if raster is already installed, only the library() command
## # needs to be run
## install.packages(&quot;raster&quot;)
library(raster)
## 
</code></pre>

<h3>Data</h3>

<p>For this tutorial, we will need three data sets from two NEON 
data products: NDVI is published in Vegetation indices (DP3.30026.001), 
and NEE and footprints are published in Eddy covariance (DP4.00200.001). 
These datasets have been pre-prepared and provided on flash drives. The 
flux data for all sites are in one file, <code>flux_allSites.csv</code>. The NDVI 
and footprint data are in paired <code>.grd</code> and <code>.gri</code> files, one pair for 
each site and flight date. Finally, the <code>flight_dates.csv</code> file contains 
the date of roughly the middle of the flight campaign, to help you line 
up the comparable flux data with the NDVI data.</p>

<p>Four sites are included, three of them with data from two years. The sites, 
from south to north, are Konza Prairie Biological Station (KONZ), Central 
Plains Experimental Range (CPER), Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory 
(NOGP), and Dakota Coteau Field Station (DCFS).</p>

<p>If you&#39;re working in R, you may want to create an R Project and 
add the data folder to it, to keep the file paths simple. The code below 
assumes this structure; otherwise, you&#39;ll simply have to modify the 
file paths.</p>

<p>Start by loading the flux data and flight dates:</p>

<pre><code>flux.all &lt;- read.csv(&quot;~/data/flux_allSites.csv&quot;)
flight.dates &lt;- read.csv(&quot;~/data/flight_dates.csv&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>Let&#39;s start by viewing the data files for a single site and year, to 
get familiar with the data. We&#39;ll use KONZ July 2020.</p>

<p>Load the footprint and NDVI data. The <code>.grd</code> and <code>.gri</code> files both 
contain information, but loading the data only requires pointing to 
the <code>.grd</code> files.</p>

<pre><code>## 
foot.KONZ &lt;- raster(&quot;~/data/footKONZ2020-07.grd&quot;)
ndvi.KONZ &lt;- raster(&quot;~/data/ndviKONZ2020-07.grd&quot;)
## 
## # if using Python and rasterio:
## footKONZ = rasterio.open(&quot;/data/footKONZ2020-07.grd&quot;)
## ndviKONZ = rasterio.open(&quot;/data/ndviKONZ2020-07.grd&quot;)
## 
</code></pre>

<h2>Explore Data from One Site</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s start by viewing the NDVI data. The <code>plot()</code> function will 
recognize the data type and create a nice image:</p>

<pre><code>plot(ndvi.KONZ)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/eddy-covariance/footprint-NDVI/rfigs/plot-KONZ-NDVI-1.png" alt=" "/></p>

<p><code>plot()</code> also works for the flux footprints, but for these data I prefer 
the look of a contour plot, which shows the boundaries of different levels 
of influence on the flux:</p>

<pre><code>filledContour(foot.KONZ, col=topo.colors(20))
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/eddy-covariance/footprint-NDVI/rfigs/plot-KONZ-foot-1.png" alt=" "/></p>

<p>To get a better look at the region contributing the most to the flux, we can 
trim the raster down to pixels with a value greater than 0.0005, using the 
<code>calc()</code> and <code>trim()</code> functions from the <code>raster</code> package. First we set all 
pixels with a low value to zero, then trim the raster to exclude those 
pixels:</p>

<pre><code>footAdj &lt;- calc(foot.KONZ, 
                 fun=function(x){ x[x &lt; 0.0005] &lt;- 0; 
                 return(x)})
footMost &lt;- trim(footAdj, values=0)
filledContour(footMost, col=topo.colors(20))
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/eddy-covariance/footprint-NDVI/rfigs/plot-trimmed-foot-1.png" alt=" "/></p>

<p>We can also overlay the NDVI and footprint data, to see where the footprint 
falls on the landscape. In this case we&#39;ll use the <code>plot()</code> function for 
clearer visuals:</p>

<pre><code>plot(ndvi.KONZ)
plot(foot.KONZ, add=T,
     col=terrain.colors(5, alpha=0.5))
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/eddy-covariance/footprint-NDVI/rfigs/plot-foot-NDVI-1.png" alt=" "/></p>

<p>Next step: calculate mean NDVI from the sampled area, and then NDVI 
weighted by the contribution of the pixel to the fluxes. Starting with 
mean NDVI, we&#39;ll use the <code>cellStats()</code> function from the <code>raster</code> 
package.</p>

<pre><code>cellStats(ndvi.KONZ, stat=&quot;mean&quot;, na.rm=T)

## [1] 0.7722162
</code></pre>

<p>To get NDVI weighted by the footprint, we need to make the two rasters 
comparable. Currently their boundaries don&#39;t match, and neither does 
their resolution. Again, the <code>raster</code> package has methods for this: 
<code>crop()</code> to crop the NDVI raster down to cover the same area as the 
footprint, and <code>resample()</code> to adjust the footprint raster to the 
resolution of the NDVI raster.</p>

<pre><code>ndvi.KONZ &lt;- crop(ndvi.KONZ, extent(foot.KONZ))
foot.KONZ &lt;- resample(foot.KONZ, ndvi.KONZ)
</code></pre>

<p>In the footprint raster, each pixel&#39;s value is its proportional 
contribution to the flux. But now that we&#39;ve resampled it to a 
different resolution, the sum of the pixels is no longer 1. We need to 
re-level the pixel values to bring them back to proportional values:</p>

<pre><code>foot.KONZ &lt;- foot.KONZ/cellStats(foot.KONZ, 
                                 stat=&quot;sum&quot;, 
                                 na.rm=T)
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can calculate the weighted NDVI, multiplying each NDVI pixel by 
its footprint weight and then using the <code>cellStats()</code> function as we 
did above:</p>

<pre><code>prop.weight &lt;- foot.KONZ*ndvi.KONZ
cellStats(prop.weight, stat=&quot;sum&quot;, 
          na.rm=T)

## [1] 0.7992741
</code></pre>

<p>Here we can see NDVI within the flux footprint is a little higher than NDVI 
across the entire region.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at the fluxes from the same time. We&#39;ll subset the 
<code>flux.all</code> table based on the site, and the dates from the <code>flight.dates</code> 
table. Let&#39;s include the date in the table, plus one on either side, 
since it&#39;s rare that the flights are completed in a single day (see 
Assumptions section below for discussion about the precise data 
collection dates).</p>

<pre><code>flux.all$timeBgn &lt;- as.POSIXct(flux.all$timeBgn, 
                               format=&quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;,
                               tz=&quot;GMT&quot;)
flux.KONZ &lt;- flux.all[which(flux.all$siteID==&quot;KONZ&quot; &amp; 
                      flux.all$timeBgn&gt;=as.POSIXct(&quot;2020-07-11&quot;, 
                                                   tz=&quot;GMT&quot;) &amp;
                      flux.all$timeBgn&lt;as.POSIXct(&quot;2020-07-14&quot;, 
                                                   tz=&quot;GMT&quot;)),]
plot(flux.KONZ$data.fluxCo2.nsae.flux~flux.KONZ$timeBgn, 
     pch=20, xlab=&quot;Date&quot;, ylab=&quot;Net ecosystem exchange&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/eddy-covariance/footprint-NDVI/rfigs/plot-KONZ-flux-1.png" alt=" "/></p>

<p>Now we have fluxes and weighted NDVI from one site, but this doesn&#39;t 
tell us much by itself! We need context from other sites and years.</p>

<h2>Calculate Weighted NDVI and Fluxes Across Sites</h2>

<p>In the next two code chunks, we&#39;ll write a function to make the 
weighted NDVI calculations above, and then loop over the sites and 
dates in the dataset. I encourage you to try out writing the 
function and the loop yourself, especially if you&#39;re working on 
developing your coding skills. But if you&#39;re not familiar with how 
to do this, you can copy the code as written below.</p>

<p>Function to calculate footprint-weighted NDVI:</p>

<pre><code>foot.weighted &lt;- function(ndvi.raster, foot.raster) {

  ndvi.foot &lt;- crop(ndvi.raster, extent(foot.raster))
  foot.ndvi &lt;- raster::resample(foot.raster, ndvi.foot)
  foot.ndvi &lt;- foot.ndvi/cellStats(foot.ndvi, stat=&quot;sum&quot;, na.rm=T)
  comb &lt;- foot.ndvi*ndvi.foot
  w.ndvi &lt;- cellStats(comb, stat=&quot;sum&quot;, na.rm=T)
  return(w.ndvi)

}
</code></pre>

<p>Loop over the rasters of all sites and dates, reading in both the NDVI 
and footprint rasters and applying the weighting function. If your data 
aren&#39;t in a project folder, or your folder structure differs, you&#39;ll 
need to adjust the file paths at the start of the for loop.</p>

<pre><code>flight.dates$month &lt;- substring(flight.dates$FlightDate, 1, 7)
ndvi.w &lt;- character()
for(i in unique(flight.dates$Site)) {

  ffls &lt;- list.files(&quot;~/data&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;, full.names=T)
  afls &lt;- list.files(&quot;~/data&quot;, &quot;ndvi&quot;, full.names=T)
  ffls &lt;- grep(&quot;.grd$&quot;, ffls, value=T)
  afls &lt;- grep(&quot;.grd$&quot;, afls, value=T)

  flight.dates.i &lt;- flight.dates[which(flight.dates$Site==i),]

  for(j in unique(flight.dates.i$month)) {

    footfl &lt;- grep(i, ffls, value=T)
    footfl &lt;- grep(j, footfl, value=T)
    if(length(footfl)==0) {next}
    nfl &lt;- grep(i, afls, value=T)
    nfl &lt;- grep(j, nfl, value=T)

    foot &lt;- raster(footfl)
    ndvi &lt;- raster(nfl)

    nw &lt;- foot.weighted(ndvi, foot)
    ndvi.w &lt;- rbind(ndvi.w, c(i, j, nw))

  }

}

ndvi.w &lt;- data.frame(ndvi.w)
names(ndvi.w) &lt;- c(&#39;site&#39;,&#39;month&#39;,&#39;ndvi&#39;)
ndvi.w$ndvi &lt;- as.numeric(ndvi.w$ndvi)

ndvi.w

##   site   month      ndvi
## 1 KONZ 2019-05 0.7561873
## 2 KONZ 2020-07 0.7992741
## 3 NOGP 2019-07 0.7307495
## 4 NOGP 2021-06 0.4495142
## 5 CPER 2020-06 0.2578832
## 6 CPER 2021-06 0.3197897
## 7 DCFS 2020-06 0.7258271
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have a table of footprint-weighted NDVI for every site and month of 
data collection. Great! All we need now is flux data to compare it to.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll again loop over the sites and dates in the dataset, but this time 
we&#39;ll subset the flux dataset to the date of the flight, plus one day on 
either side, and calculate the daily net ecosystem exchange. Again, I 
encourage you to give this a try on your own, but the code I used to do 
it is in the next code chunk.</p>

<pre><code>ndvi.w$flux &lt;- NA
flight.dates$FlightDate &lt;- as.POSIXct(flight.dates$FlightDate, 
                                      tz=&quot;GMT&quot;)
for(i in 1:nrow(flight.dates)) {

  flux.sub &lt;- flux.all[which(flux.all$siteID==
                               flight.dates$Site[i] &amp; 
                        flux.all$timeBgn&gt;=
                          I(flight.dates$FlightDate[i]-86400) &amp;
                        flux.all$timeBgn&lt;
                          I(flight.dates$FlightDate[i]+86400)),]
  fl &lt;- mean(flux.sub$data.fluxCo2.nsae.flux, na.rm=T)
  ndvi.w$flux[which(ndvi.w$site==flight.dates$Site[i] &amp; 
                      ndvi.w$month==flight.dates$month[i])] &lt;- fl

}

# convert to units of grams of carbon per meter squared per day
ndvi.w$flux &lt;- ndvi.w$flux*1e-6*12.011*86400
</code></pre>

<p>Now plot NEE against weighted NDVI:</p>

<pre><code>plot(ndvi.w$flux~ndvi.w$ndvi, 
     xlab=&quot;NDVI&quot;, ylab=&quot;NEE&quot;,
     pch=20)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/eddy-covariance/footprint-NDVI/rfigs/plot-flux-NDVI-1.png" alt=" "/></p>

<p>To get a little more insight, let&#39;s plot the site code for each data 
point:</p>

<pre><code>plot(ndvi.w$flux~ndvi.w$ndvi, 
     xlab=&quot;NDVI&quot;, ylab=&quot;NEE&quot;,
     type=&quot;n&quot;, pch=20)
text(ndvi.w$ndvi, ndvi.w$flux,
     labels=ndvi.w$site, cex=0.5)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/eddy-covariance/footprint-NDVI/rfigs/plot-flux-NDVI-sites-1.png" alt=" "/></p>

<p>We can see that increasing NDVI is associated with increased carbon 
uptake. But we calculated this using overall NEE, which includes 
respiration. Depending on our analysis, it might be more appropriate 
to try to build a model to predict uptake, and to model respiration 
separately.</p>

<p>To do this properly, we&#39;d need to use flux partitioning methods, 
but we can get a very crude idea of what the results might look like
by re-calculating our NEE estimate using only the negative values 
from each day. We&#39;ll re-use the flux calculation for loop above:</p>

<pre><code>ndvi.w$dayflux &lt;- NA
for(i in 1:nrow(flight.dates)) {

  flux.sub &lt;- flux.all[which(flux.all$siteID==
                               flight.dates$Site[i] &amp; 
                        flux.all$timeBgn&gt;=
                          I(flight.dates$FlightDate[i]-86400) &amp;
                        flux.all$timeBgn&lt;
                          I(flight.dates$FlightDate[i]+86400)),]
  fl &lt;- mean(flux.sub$data.fluxCo2.nsae.flux
             [which(flux.sub$data.fluxCo2.nsae.flux&lt;0)], na.rm=T)
  ndvi.w$dayflux[which(ndvi.w$site==flight.dates$Site[i] &amp; 
                      ndvi.w$month==flight.dates$month[i])] &lt;- fl

}

ndvi.w$dayflux &lt;- ndvi.w$dayflux*1e-6*12.011*86400
</code></pre>

<p>And plot carbon uptake as above:</p>

<pre><code>plot(ndvi.w$dayflux~ndvi.w$ndvi, 
     xlab=&quot;NDVI&quot;, ylab=&quot;Daytime NEE&quot;,
     type=&quot;n&quot;, pch=20)
text(ndvi.w$ndvi, ndvi.w$dayflux,
     labels=ndvi.w$site, cex=0.5)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/eddy-covariance/footprint-NDVI/rfigs/plot-dayflux-NDVI-sites-1.png" alt=" "/></p>

<p>The relationship is much tighter when we consider only net 
uptake values.</p>

<h2>Assumptions, Simplifications, and Further Possibilities</h2>

<p>As mentioned, it&#39;s best to model GEE and respiration separately, 
and we would expect NDVI to have a much stronger relationship with 
GEE than respiration. But that&#39;s not the only way our analysis 
here is limited relative to what&#39;s possible.</p>

<p>To simplify our calculations of which fluxes correspond to the NDVI 
values, I provided the <code>flight.dates</code> table, which contains a single 
date for each site and year. In reality, the flights usually span 
several days, which are often not consecutive. In addition to 
simplifying the flight info, the flux footprints in the provided dataset 
are averaged over all the days when the plane was overhead.</p>

<p>The data product <a href="https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP3.30006.001" target="_blank">Spectrometer orthorectified surface directional reflectance - mosaic (DP3.30006.001)</a> includes data tiles containing the 
flight date when each pixel was collected. The expanded package of the 
flux data product, <a href="https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP4.00200.001" target="_blank">Bundled data products - eddy covariance (DP4.00200.001)</a> 
includes flux footprints for every half-hourly flux calculation interval. 
It is possible to use these datasets to calculate the contribution 
to the flux of every NDVI pixel at the time it was observed. However, 
this would be a very elaborate calculation, and before going down that 
road, consider the scientific question you&#39;re trying to answer. Given what 
you know about uncertainties in fluxes, uncertainties in NDVI, and the 
relative rates of change of NDVI and NEE over time, is your question 
sensitive to this level of detail?</p>

<p>Considering sensitivity raises another question: How important were the 
flux footprints to our analysis? How different would the results be if 
we simply calculated NDVI for, say, a one kilometer radius around the 
tower? This is an easy question to answer, with only a small 
modification to the code above. Give it a try, and again, consider the 
types of analyses that might demand different levels of precision.</p>

<p>Finally, note that in our dataset, we had three pairs of repeat 
measurements at the same site. In general, we would expect much better 
model predictions within a site than between sites. And we restricted 
ourselves to Great Plains grasslands. How would we expect this 
exercise to differ if we expanded into other site types?</p>
