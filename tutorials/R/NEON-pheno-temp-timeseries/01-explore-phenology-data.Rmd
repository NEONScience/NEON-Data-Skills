Plants change throughout the year - these are phenophases. 
Why do they change? 

## Explore Phenology Data 

The following sections provide a brief overview of the NEON plant phenology 
observation data. When designing a research project using this data, you 
need to consult the 
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-view?dpCode=DP1.10055.001" target="_blank">documents associated with this data product</a> and not rely soley on this summary. 

*The following description of the NEON Plant Phenology Observation data is modified 
from the <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/NEON_phenology_userGuide_vA" target="_blank"> data product user guide</a>.*

### NEON Plant Phenology Observation Data

NEON collects plant phenology data and provides it as NEON data product 
**NEON.DP1.10055**.

The plant phenology observations data product provides in-situ observations of 
the phenological status and intensity of tagged plants (or patches) during 
discrete observations events. 

Sampling occurs at all terrestrial field sites at site and season specific 
intervals. Three species for phenology observation are selected based on relative 
abundance in the Tower airshed. There are 30 individuals of each target species 
monitored at each transect. 

#### Status-based Monitoring

NEON employs status-based monitoring, in which the phenological condition of an 
individual is reported any time that individual is observed. At every observations 
bout, records are generated for every phenophase that is occurring and for every 
phenophase not occurring. With this approach, events (such as leaf emergence in 
Mediterranean climates, or flowering in many desert species) that may occur 
multiple times during a single year, can be captured. Continuous reporting of
phenophase status enables quantification of the duration of phenophases rather 
than just their date of onset while allows enabling the explicit quantification 
of uncertainty in phenophase transition dates that are introduced by monitoring 
in discrete temporal bouts.

Specific products derived from this sampling include the observed phenophase 
status (whether or not a phenophase is occurring) and the intensity of 
phenophases for individuals in which phenophase status = ‘yes’. Phenophases 
reported are derived from the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) categories. 
The number of phenophases observed varies by growth form and ranges from 1 
phenophase (cactus) to 7 phenophases (semi-evergreen broadleaf). 
In this tutorial we will focus only on the state of the phenophase, not the 
phenophase intensity data. 

#### Phenology Transects 

Plant phenology observations occurs at all terrestrial NEON sites along an 800 
meter square loop transect (primary) and within a 200 m x 200 m plot located 
within view of a canopy level, tower-mounted, phenology camera.

#### Timing of Observations

At each site, there are: 

* ~50 observation bouts per year. 
* no more that 100 sampling points per phenology transect.
* no more than 9 sampling points per phenocam plot. 
* 1 bout per year to collect annual size and disease status measurements from 
each sampling point.


#### Available Data Tables

In the downloaded data packet, data are available in two main files

* **phe_statusintensity:** Plant phenophase status and intensity data 
* **phe_perindividual:** Geolocation and taxonomic identification for phenology plants
* **phe_perindividualperyear:** recorded once a year, essentially the "metadata" 
about the plant: DBH, height, etc. 


There are other files in each download including a **readme** with information on 
the data product and the download; a **variables** file that defines the 
term descriptions, data types, and units; a **validation** file with ata entry validation and 
parsing rules; and an **XML** with machine readable metadata. 

## Stack NEON Data

NEON data are delivered in a site and year-month format. When you download data,
you will get a single zipped file containing a directory for each month and site that you've 
requested data for. Dealing with these seperate tables from even one or two sites
over a 12 month period can be a bit overwhelming. Luckily NEON provides an R package
**neonDataStackR** that takes the unzipped downloaded file and joining the data 
files. 

When we do this for phenology data we get three files, one for each data table, 
with all the data from your site and date range of interest. 

Let's start by loading our data of interest. 


```{r loadStuff}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)  


# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import
# setwd("working-dir-path-here")


# Read in data
ind <- read.csv('NEON-pheno-temp-timeseries/pheno/phe_perindividual.csv', 
		stringsAsFactors = FALSE )

status <- read.csv('NEON-pheno-temp-timeseries/pheno/phe_statusintensity.csv', 
		stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```

Let's explore the data. Let's get to know what the `ind` dataframe looks like.

```{r look-ind}
# What are the fieldnames in this dataset?
names(ind)

# how many rows are in the data?
nrow(ind)

# look at the first six rows of data.
head(ind)

# look at the structure of the dataframe.
str(ind)

```

Note that if you first open you data file in Excel, you might see 06/14/2014 as 
the format instead of 2014-06-14. Excel can do some ~~wierd~~ interesting things
to dates.

#### Individual locations

To get the specific location data of each individual you would need to do some 
math, or you can use the NEON geolocation 
<a href="https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-geolocation" target="_blank"> **geoNEON**</a>. 

Now let's look at the status data. 

```{r look-status}

# What variables are included in this dataset?
names(status)
nrow(status)
head(status)
str(status)

# date range
min(status$date)
max(status$date)

```

The `uid` is not important to understanding the data so we are going to remove `uid`. 
However, if you are every reporting an error in the data you should include this
with your report. 

```{r remove-uid}

ind <- select(ind,-uid)
status <- select (status, -uid)

``` 

## Clean up the Data

* remove duplicates (full rows)
* convert date
* retain only the latest `editedDate` in the perIndividual table.

### Remove Duplicates

The indivdual table (ind) file is included in each site by month-year file. As 
a result when all the tables are stacked there are many duplicates. 

Let's remove any duplicates that exist.

```{r remove-duplicates}
# remove duplicates
## expect many

ind_noD <- distinct(ind)
nrow(ind_noD)

status_noD<-distinct(status)
nrow(status_noD)

```


### Variable Overlap between Tables

From the initial inspection of the data we can see there is overlap in variable
names between the fields. 

Let's see what they are.

```{r same-fieldnames}

# where is there an intersection of names
sameName <- intersect(names(status_noD), names(ind_noD))
sameName

```

There are several fields that overlap between the data sets. Some of these are
expected to be the same and will be what we join on. 

However, some of these will have different values in each table. We want to keep 
those distinct value and not join on them. 

We want to rename common fields before joining:

* editedDate
* measuredBy
* recordedBy
* samplingProtocolVersion
* remarks
* dataQF

Now we want to rename the variables that would have duplicate names. We can 
rename all the variables in the status object to have "Stat" at the end of the 
variable name. 

```{r rename-column}

# rename status editedDate
status_noD <- rename(status_noD, editedDateStat=editedDate, 
		measuredByStat=measuredBy, recordedByStat=recordedBy, 
		samplingProtocolVersionStat=samplingProtocolVersion, 
		remarksStat=remarks, dataQFStat=dataQF)


```


### Convert to Date

Our `addDate` and `date` columns are stored as a `character` class. We need to 
convert it to a date class. The `as.Date()` function in base R will do this. 

```{r as-date-only }

# convert column to date class
ind_noD$editedDate <- as.Date(ind_noD$editedDate)
str(ind_noD$editedDate)

status_noD$date <- as.Date(status_noD$date)
str(status_noD$date)

```

The individual (ind) table contains all instances that any of the location or 
taxonomy data of an individual was updated. Therefore there are many rows for
some individuals.  We only want the latest `editedDate` on ind. 

```{r filter-edit-date}
# retain only the max of the date for each individualID
ind_last <- ind_noD %>%
	group_by(individualID) %>%
	filter(editedDate==max(editedDate))

# oh wait, duplicate dates, retain only one
ind_lastnoD <- ind_last %>%
	group_by(editedDate, individualID) %>%
	filter(row_number()==1)

```

### Join Dataframes

Now we can join the two data frames on all the variables with the same name. 
We use a `left_join()` from the dpylr package because we want to match all the 
rows from the "left" (first) dateframe to any rows that also occur in the "right"
 (second) dataframe.  
 
 Check out RStudio's 
 <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf" target="_blank"> data wrangling (dplyr/tidyr) cheatsheet</a>
 for other types of joins. 
 
```{r join-dfs-error}

# Create a new dataframe "phe_ind" with all the data from status and some from ind_lastnoD
phe_ind <- left_join(status_noD, ind_lastnoD)


```

Ack!  Two different data types.  Why?  NA in taxonID is a logicial, but all the 
names are character.  

Try it again.  

`taxonID` and `scientificName` are provided for convenience in Status table, but
most up to date data are always in the `phe_perindividual.csv` files. Therefore, 
we'll remove from the columns from the status data. (This is one more reason why you want to 
fully read the documents associated with the data products!).

```{r join-dfs}
# drop taxonID, scientificName
status_noD <- select (status_noD, -taxonID, -scientificName)

# Create a new dataframe "phe_ind" with all the data from status and some from ind_lastnoD
phe_ind <- left_join(status_noD, ind_lastnoD)

```

Worked this time! 
Now that we have clean datasets we can begin looking into our particular data to 
address our research question: do plants show patterns of changes in phenophase 
across season?

## Patterns in Phenophase  

From our larger data set (several sites, species, phenophases), let's create a
dataframe with only the data from a single site, species, and phenophase and 
call it `phe_1sp`.

## Select Site(s) of Interest

To do this, we'll first select our site of interest. Note how we set this up 
with an object that is our site of interest. This will allow us to more easily change 
which site or sites if we want to adapt our code later. 

```{r filter-site}

# set site of interest
siteOfInterest <- "SCBI"

# use filter to select only the site of Interest 
## using %in% allows one to add a vector if you want more than one site. 
## could also do it with == instead of %in% but won't work with vectors

phe_1sp <- filter(phe_ind, siteID %in% siteOfInterest)



```

## Select Species of Interest

And now select a single species of interest. For now let's choose the flowering 
tree *Liriodendron tulipifera* (LITU). 

```{r filter-species}

# see which species are present
unique(phe_1sp$taxonID)

speciesOfInterest <- "LITU"

#subset to just "LITU"
# here just use == but could also use %in%
phe_1sp <- filter(phe_1sp, taxonID==speciesOfInterest)

# check that it worked
unique(phe_1sp$taxonID)

```


## Select Phenophase of Interest

And, perhaps a single phenophase. 

```{r filter-phonophase}

# see which species are present
unique(phe_1sp$phenophaseName)

phenophaseOfInterest <- "Leaves"

#subset to just the phenosphase of Interest 
phe_1sp <- filter(phe_1sp, phenophaseName %in% phenophaseOfInterest)

# check that it worked
unique(phe_1sp$phenophaseName)

```

## Total in Phenophase of Interest

The `phenophaseState` is recorded as "yes" or "no" that the individual is in that
phenophase. The `phenophaseIntensity` are categories for how much of the indvidual
is in that state. For now, we will stick with `phenophaseState`. 

We can now calculate the total indivdiual with that state. 

Here we use pipes `%>%` from the dpylr package to "pass" objects onto the next
function. 

```{r calc-total-yes}

# Total in status by day
sampSize <- count(phe_1sp, date)
inStat <- phe_1sp %>%
	group_by(date) %>%
  count(phenophaseStatus)
inStat <- full_join(sampSize, inStat, by="date")

# Retain only Yes
inStat_T <- filter(inStat, phenophaseStatus %in% "yes")

```

Now that we have the data we can plot it. 

## Plot with ggplot

The `ggplot()` function within the `ggplot2` package gives us considerable control
over plot appearance. Three basic elements are needed for `ggplot()` to work:

 1. The **data_frame:** containing the variables that we wish to plot,
 2. **`aes` (aesthetics):** which denotes which variables will map to the x-, y-
 (and other) axes,  
 3. **`geom_XXXX` (geometry):** which defines the data's graphical representation
 (e.g. points (`geom_point`), bars (`geom_bar`), lines (`geom_line`), etc).
 
The syntax begins with the base statement that includes the `data_frame`
(`inStat_T`) and associated x (`date`) and y (`n`) variables to be
plotted:

`ggplot(inStat_T, aes(date, n))`

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** For a more detailed introduction to 
using `ggplot()`, visit 
<a href="/dc-time-series-plot-ggplot-r" target="_blank"> *Time Series 05: Plot Time Series with ggplot2 in R* tutorial</a>. 
</div>

### Bar Plots with ggplot
To successfully plot, the last piece that is needed is the `geom`etry type. 
To create a bar plot, we set the `geom` element from to `geom_bar()`.  

The default setting for a ggplot bar plot -  `geom_bar()` - is a histogram
designated by `stat="bin"`. However, in this case, we want to plot count values. 
We can use `geom_bar(stat="identity")` to force ggplot to plot actual values.

```{r plot-leaves-total}

# plot number of individuals in leaf
phenoPlot <- ggplot(inStat_T, aes(date, n.y)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", na.rm = TRUE) 

phenoPlot


# Now let's make the plot look a bit more presentable
phenoPlot <- ggplot(inStat_T, aes(date, n.y)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", na.rm = TRUE) +
    ggtitle("Total Individuals in Leaf") +
    xlab("Date") + ylab("Number of Individuals") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold", size = 20)) +
    theme(text = element_text(size=18))

phenoPlot

```

We could also covert this to percentage and plot that. 

```{r plot-leaves-percentage}

# convert to percent
inStat_T$percent<- ((inStat_T$n.y)/inStat_T$n.x)*100

# plot percent of leaves
phenoPlot_P <- ggplot(inStat_T, aes(date, percent)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", na.rm = TRUE) +
    ggtitle("Proportion in Leaf") +
    xlab("Date") + ylab("% of Individuals") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold", size = 20)) +
    theme(text = element_text(size=18))

phenoPlot_P

```

The plots demonstrate that, while the 2016 data show the nice expected pattern 
of increasing leaf-out, peak, and drop-off, we seem to be missing the increase 
in leaf-out in 2015. Looking at the data, we see that there was no data collected
before May of 2015 -- we're missing most of leaf out!

## Filter by Date

That may create problems with downstream analyses. Let's filter the dataset to 
include just 2016.

```{r filter-to-2016}

# use filter to select only the site of Interest 
phe_1sp_2016 <- filter(inStat_T, date >= "2016-01-01")

# did it work?
range(phe_1sp_2016$date)

```

How does that look? 

```{r plot-2016}

# Now let's make the plot look a bit more presentable
phenoPlot16 <- ggplot(phe_1sp_2016, aes(date, n.y)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", na.rm = TRUE) +
    ggtitle("Total Individuals in Leaf") +
    xlab("Date") + ylab("Number of Individuals") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold", size = 20)) +
    theme(text = element_text(size=18))

phenoPlot16

```


## Drivers of Phenology

Now that we see that there are differences in and shifts in phenophases, what 
are the drivers of phenophases?

The NEON phenology measurements track sensitive and easily observed indicators 
of biotic responses to climate variability by monitoring the timing and duration 
of phenological stagesin plant communities. Plant phenology is affected by forces 
such as temperature, timing and duration of pest infestations and disease outbreaks, 
water fluxes, nutrient budgets, carbon dynamics, and food availability and has 
feedbacks to trophic interactions, carbon sequestration, community composition 
and ecosystem function.  (quoted from 
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/NEON_phenology_userGuide_vA" target="_blank"> Plant Phenology Observations user guide</a>.)


```{r write-csv, echo = FALSE}
# Write .csv (this will be read in new in subsuquent lessons)

```
