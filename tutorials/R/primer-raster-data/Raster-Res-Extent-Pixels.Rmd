## Learning Objectives:

After completing this activity, you will be able to:

* Explain the key attributes required to work with raster data including: spatial 
extent, coordinate reference system and spatial resolution.
* Describe what a spatial extent is and how it relates to resolution.
* Explain the basics of coordinate reference systems.

## Things You’ll Need To Complete This Tutorial
You will need the most current version of R and, preferably, `RStudio` loaded 
on your computer to complete this tutorial.

### Install R Packages

* **raster**: `install.packages("raster")`
* **rgdal**: `install.packages("rgdal")`

### Data to Download

{% include/dataSubsets/_data_Field-Site-Spatial-Data.html %}

<p>The LiDAR and imagery data used to create the rasters in this dataset were 
collected over the San Joaquin field site located in California (NEON Domain 17) 
and processed at <a href="/" target="_blank" >NEON </a> 
headquarters. The entire dataset can be accessed by request from the NEON website.</p>  

This data download contains several files used in related tutorials. The path to 
the files we will be using in this tutorial is:
NEON-DS-Field-Site-Spatial-Data/SJER/.  
You should set your working directory to the parent directory of the downloaded 
data to follow the code exactly. 

</div>

This tutorial will overview the key attributes of a raster object, including 
spatial extent, resolution and coordinate reference system. When working within
a GIS system often these attributes are accounted for. However, it is important
to be more familiar with them when working in non-GUI environments such as 
 R or even `Python`.

In order to correctly spatially reference a raster that is not already georeferenced,
you will also need to identify:

1. The lower left hand corner coordinates of the raster.
2. The number of columns and rows that the raster dataset contains.
 
## Spatial Resolution
A raster consists of a series of pixels, each with the same dimensions 
and shape. In the case of rasters derived from airborne sensors, each pixel 
represents an area of space on the Earth's surface. The size of the area on the 
surface that each pixel covers is known as the spatial resolution of the image. 
For instance, an image that has a 1 m spatial resolution means that each pixel in 
the image represents a 1 m x 1 m area.

## Load the Data

Let's open up a raster in R to see how the attributes are stored. We are 
going to work with a Digital Terrain Model from the San Joaquin Experimental 
Range in California. 

```{r load-data }

# load packages 
library(raster)  
library(rgdal)

# Load raster in an R object called 'DEM'
DEM <- raster("NEON-DS-Field-Site-Spatial-Data/SJER/DigitalTerrainModel/SJER2013_DTM.tif")  

# set working directory to data folder
#setwd("pathToDirHere")

```

```{r view-raster-attributes}
# View raster attributes 
DEM

```

Note that this raster (in GeoTIFF format) already has an extent, resolution, and 
CRS defined. The resolution in both x and y directions is 1. The CRS tells us 
that the x,y units of the data are meters (m). 

## Spatial Extent
The spatial extent of a raster, represents the "X, Y" coordinates of the corners 
of the raster in geographic space. This information, in addition to the cell 
size or spatial resolution, tells the program how to place or render each pixel 
in 2 dimensional space.  Tools like R, using supporting packages such as `rgdal` 
and associated raster tools have functions that allow you to view and define the 
extent of a new raster. 

```{r set-raster-extent }

# View the extent of the raster
DEM@extent

```

    stretched over the larger area making it look more "blury".  Source: National
    Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)
    </figcaption>
</figure>

### Calculating Raster Extent
Extent and spatial resolution are closely connected. To calculate the extent of a 
raster, we first need the bottom **left hand** (X,Y) coordinate of the raster. In 
the case of the UTM coordinate system which is in meters, to calculate
the raster's extent, we can add the number of columns and rows to the X,Y corner 
coordinate location of the raster, multiplied by the resolution (the pixel size) 
of the raster.

    <figcaption>To be located geographically, a raster's location needs to be 
    defined in geographic space (i.e., on a spatial grid). The spatial extent 
    defines the four corners of a raster within a given coordinate reference 
    system. Source: National Ecological Observatory Network. </figcaption>
</figure>

Let's explore that next, using a blank raster that we create. 

```{r create-raster }

# create a raster from the matrix - a "blank" raster of 4x4
myRaster1 <- raster(nrow=4, ncol=4)

# assign "data" to raster: 1 to n based on the number of cells in the raster
myRaster1[]<- 1:ncell(myRaster1)

# view attributes of the raster
myRaster1

# is the CRS defined?
myRaster1@crs

```

Wait, why is the CRS defined on this new raster? This is the default values
for something created with the `raster()` function if nothing is defined. 

Let's get back to looking at more attributes. 

```{r create-raster-cont}

# what is the raster extent?
myRaster1@extent

# plot raster
plot(myRaster1, main="Raster with 16 pixels")

```

Here we see our raster with the value of 1 to 16 in each pixel. 

We can resample the raster as well to adjust the resolution. If we want a **higher
resolution** raster, we will apply a grid with **more pixels** within the same extent.
If we want a **lower resolution** raster, we will apply a grid with **fewer pixels**
within the same extent.

One way to do this is to create a raster of the resolution you want and then 
`resample()` your original raster. The resampling will be done for either
nearest neighbor assignments (for categorical data) or bilinear interpolation (for
numerical data). 

```{r resample-raster }
## HIGHER RESOLUTION
# Create 32 pixel raster
myRaster2 <- raster(nrow=8, ncol=8)

# resample 16 pix raster with 32 pix raster
# use bilinear interpolation with our numeric data
myRaster2 <- resample(myRaster1, myRaster2, method='bilinear')

# notice new dimensions, resolution, & min/max 
myRaster2

# plot 
plot(myRaster2, main="Raster with 32 pixels")

## LOWER RESOLUTION
myRaster3 <- raster(nrow=2, ncol=2)
myRaster3 <- resample(myRaster1, myRaster3, method='bilinear')
myRaster3
plot(myRaster3, main="Raster with 4 pixels")

## SINGLE PIXEL RASTER
myRaster4 <- raster(nrow=1, ncol=1)
myRaster4 <- resample(myRaster1, myRaster4, method='bilinear')
myRaster4
plot(myRaster4, main="Raster with 1 pixel")

```

To more easily compare them, let's create a graphic layout with 4 rasters in it. 
Notice that each raster has the same extent but each a different resolution 
because it has a different number of pixels spread out over the same extent.

``` {r quad-layout}
# change graphical parameter to 2x2 grid
par(mfrow=c(2,2))

# arrange plots in order you wish to see them
plot(myRaster2, main="Raster with 32 pixels")
plot(myRaster1, main="Raster with 16 pixels")
plot(myRaster3, main="Raster with 4 pixels")
plot(myRaster4, main="Raster with 2 pixels")

# change graphical parameter back to 1x1 
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

```

## Coordinate Reference System & Projection Information

> A spatial reference system (SRS) or coordinate reference system (CRS) is a 
coordinate-based local, regional or global system used to locate geographical 
entities. -- Wikipedia

The earth is round. This is not an new concept by any means, however we need to 
remember this when we talk about coordinate reference systems associated with 
spatial data. When we make maps on paper or on a computer screen, we are moving 
from a 3 dimensional space (the globe) to 2 dimensions (our computer screens or 
a piece of paper). To keep this short, the projection of a dataset relates to 
how the data are "flattened" in geographic space so our human eyes and brains 
can make sense of the information in 2 dimensions. 

The projection refers to the mathematical calculations performed to "flatten the 
data" in into 2D space. The coordinate system references to the x and y coordinate 
space that is associated with the projection used to flatten the data. If you 
have the same dataset saved in two different projections, these two files won't 
line up correctly when rendered together.

Check out this short video,

## What Makes Spatial Data Line Up On A Map?
There are lots of great resources that describe coordinate reference systems and 
projections in greater detail. However, for the purposes of this activity, what 
is important to understand is that data from the same location but saved in 
different projections **will not line up in any GIS or other program**. Thus 
it's important when working with spatial data in a program like R or `Python` 
to identify the coordinate reference system applied to the data, and to grab 
that information and retain it when you process / analyze the data.

For a library of CRS information: 
<a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/" target="_blank">A great online 
library of CRS information.</a>

## CRS proj4 Strings

The rgdal package has all the common ESPG codes with proj4string built in. We 
can see them by creating an object of the function `make_ESPG()`. 

```{r view-CRS-strings }

# make sure you loaded rgdal package at the top of your script

# create an object with all ESPG codes
epsg = make_EPSG()

# use View(espg) to see the full table - doesn't render on website well
#View(epsg)

# View top 5 entries
head(epsg, 5)

```


### Define the extent

In the above raster example, we created several simple raster objects in R. 
R defaulted to a global lat/long extent. We can define the exact extent that we 
need to use too. 

Let's create a new raster with the same projection as our original DEM. We know 
that our data are in UTM zone 11N. For the sake of this exercise, let say we 
want to create a raster with the left hand corner coordinate at:  

* xmin = 254570
* ymin = 4107302

The resolution of this new raster will be `1 meter` and we will be working
in UTM (meters). First, let's set up the raster. 

```{r create-raster-extent}
# create 10x20 matrix with values 1-8. 
newMatrix  <- (matrix(1:8, nrow = 10, ncol = 20))

# convert to raster
rasterNoProj <- raster(newMatrix)
rasterNoProj

```

Now we can define the new raster's extent by defining the lower left corner of
the raster.

```{r define-extent}
## Define the xmin and ymin (the lower left hand corner of the raster)

# 1. define xMin & yMin objects.
xMin = 254570
yMin = 4107302

# 2. grab the cols and rows for the raster using @ncols and @nrows
rasterNoProj@ncols
rasterNoProj@nrows

# 3. raster resolution
res <- 1.0

# 4. add the numbers of cols and rows to the x,y corner location, 
# result = we get the bounds of our raster extent. 
xMax <- xMin + (rasterNoProj@ncols * res)
yMax <- yMin + (rasterNoProj@nrows * res)

# 5.create a raster extent class
rasExt <- extent(xMin,xMax,yMin,yMax)
rasExt

# 6. apply the extent to our raster
rasterNoProj@extent <- rasExt

# Did it work? 
rasterNoProj
# or view extent only
rasterNoProj@extent

```

Now we have an extent associated with our raster which places it in space!

``` {r plot-raster-our-extent}
# plot new raster
plot(rasterNoProj, main="Raster in UTM coordinates, 1 m resolution")

```

Notice that the coordinates show up on our plot now.

## Challenges: Resample Rasters

Now apply your skills in a new way! 

* Resample `rasterNoProj` from 1 meter to 10 meter resolution. Plot it next to the 1 m 
resolution raster. Use: `par(mfrow=c(1,2))` to create side by side plots.
* What happens to the extent if you change the resolution to 1.5 when calculating 
the raster's extent properties??

</div>

## Define Projection of a Raster

We can define the projection of a raster that has a known CRS already. Sometimes
we download data that have projection information associated with them but the CRS
is not defined either in the GeoTIFF tags or in the raster itself. If this is the 
case, we can simply assign the raster the correct projection. 

**Be careful doing this** - it is **not** the same thing as reprojecting your data.

Let's define the projection for our newest raster using the DEM raster that 
already has defined CRS. NOTE: in this case we have to know that our raster is 
in this projection already so we don't run the risk of assigning the wrong projection
to the data.

```{r define-raster-projection }

# view CRS from raster of interest
rasterNoProj@crs

# view the CRS of our DEM object.
DEM@crs

# define the CRS using a CRS of another raster
rasterNoProj@crs <- DEM@crs

# look at the attributes
rasterNoProj

# view just the crs
rasterNoProj@crs

```

IMPORTANT: the above code **does not reproject** the raster. It simply defines the
Coordinate Reference System based upon the CRS of another raster. If you want to
actually change the CRS of a raster, you need to use the `projectRaster` function.


<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
## Challenge: Assign CRS

You can set the CRS and extent of a raster using the syntax 
`rasterWithoutReference@crs <- rasterWithReference@crs` and 
`rasterWithoutReference@extent <- rasterWithReference@extent`. Using this information: 

* open `band90.tif` in the `rasterLayers_tif` folder and plot it. (You could consider looking
at it in <a href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/" target="_blank">QGIS</a> first 
to compare it to the other rasters.)  
* Does it line up with our DEM? Look closely at the extent and pixel size. Does anything look off? 
* Fix what is missing. 
* (Advanced step) Export a new GeoTIFF Do things line up in 
<a href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/" target="_blank">QGIS?</a>

The code below creates a raster and seeds it with some data. Experiment with the 
code. 

* What happens to the resulting raster's resolution when you change the range 
of lat and long values to 5 instead of 10? Try 20, 50 and 100? 
* What is the relationship between the extent and the raster resolution?

</div>

``` {r challenge-example-code}
## Challenge Example Code 

# set latLong
latLong <- data.frame(longitude=seq( 0,10,1), latitude=seq( 0,10,1))

# make spatial points dataframe, which will have a spatial extent
sp <- SpatialPoints( latLong[ c("longitude" , "latitude") ], proj4string = CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84") )

# make raster based on the extent of your data
r <- raster(nrow=5, ncol=5, extent( sp ) )

r[]  <- 1
r[]  <- sample(0:50,25)
r
```


## Reprojecting Data
If you run into multiple spatial datasets with varying projections, you can 
always **reproject** the data so that they are all in the same projection. Python 
and R both have reprojection tools that perform this task.

```{r reproject-data }

# reproject raster data from UTM to CRS of Lat/Long WGS84
reprojectedData1 <- projectRaster(rasterNoProj, 
                                 crs="+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs ")

# note that the extent has been adjusted to account for the NEW crs
reprojectedData1@crs
reprojectedData1@extent

# note the range of values in the output data
reprojectedData1

# use nearest neighbor interpolation method to ensure that the values stay the same
reprojectedData2 <- projectRaster(rasterNoProj, 
                                 crs="+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs ", 
                                 method = "ngb")


# note that the min and max values have now been forced to stay within the same range.
reprojectedData2

```
