## Raster Data
Raster or "gridded" data are data that are saved in pixels. In the spatial world, 
each pixel represents an area on the Earth's surface. An color image raster is 
a bit different from other rasters in that it has multiple bands. Each band 
represents reflectance values for a particular color or spectra of light. If the 
image is RGB, then the bands are in the red, green and blue portions of the 
electromagnetic spectrum. These colors together create what we know as a full 
color image.

## Work with Multiple Rasters

In [a previous tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/R/Raster-Data-In-R/), we loaded a 
single raster into R. We made sure we knew the `CRS` 
(coordinate reference system) and extent of the dataset among other key metadata 
attributes. This raster was a Digital Elevation Model so there was only a single
raster that represented the ground elevation in each pixel. When we work with 
color images, there are multiple rasters to represent each band. Here we'll learn
to work with multiple rasters together. 

### Raster Stacks

A raster stack is a collection of raster layers. Each raster layer in the raster 
stack needs to have the same 

* projection (CRS), 
* spatial extent and 
* resolution. 

You might use raster stacks for different reasons. For instance, you might want to 
group a time series of rasters representing precipitation or temperature into 
one R object. Or, you might want to create a color images from red, green and 
blue band derived rasters.

In this tutorial, we will stack three bands from a multi-band image together to 
create a composite RGB image.

First let's load the R packages that we need: `sp` and `raster`. 

``` {r set-up}

# load the raster, sp, and rgdal packages
library(raster)
library(sp)
library(rgdal)

# set the working directory to the data
#setwd("pathToDirHere")
```

Next, let's create a raster stack with bands representing 

* blue: band 19, 473.8nm
* green: band 34, 548.9nm 
* red; band 58, 669.1nm 

This can be done by individually assigning each file path as an object. 

```{r import-tiffs}

# import tiffs
band19 <- "NEON-DS-Field-Site-Spatial-Data/SJER/RGB/band19.tif"
band34 <- "NEON-DS-Field-Site-Spatial-Data/SJER/RGB/band34.tif"
band58 <- "NEON-DS-Field-Site-Spatial-Data/SJER/RGB/band58.tif"
```

Note that if we wanted to create a stack from all the files in a directory (folder)
you can easily do this with the `list.files()` function. We would use 
`full.names=TRUE` to ensure that R will store the directory path in our list of
rasters.

``` {r list-files}
# create list of files to make raster stack
rasterlist1 <-  list.files('RGB', full.names=TRUE)
```

Or, if your directory is consistes of some .tif files and other file types you 
don't want in your stack, you can ask R to only list those files with a .tif 
extension.

```{r list-files-tif}
rasterlist2 <-  list.files('RGB', full.names=TRUE, pattern="tif") 
```

Back to creating our raster stack with three bands.  We only want three of the 
bands in the RGB directory and not the fourth `band90`, so will create the stack
from the bands we loaded individually. We do this with the `stack()` function. 

``` {r r-stack}
# create raster stack
rgbRaster <- stack(band19,band34,band58)

# example syntax for stack from a list
#rstack1 <- stack(rasterlist1)
```

This has now created a stack of rasters three thick. Let's view them. 

``` {r view-stack}
# check attributes
rgbRaster

# plot stack
plot(rgbRaster)

```

From the attributes we see the CRS, resolution, and extent of all three rasters. 
The we can see each raster plotted. Notice the different shading between the 
different bands. This is because the landscape relects in the red, green, and 
blue spectra differently. 

Check out the scale bars. What do they represent? 

This reflectance data is radiance corrected for atmospheric effects. The data 
are typically unitless and ranges from 0-1. NEON Airborne Observation Platform
data, where these rasters come from, has a scale factor of 10,000. 

## Plot an RGB Image

You can plot a composite RGB image from a raster stack. You need to specify the 
order of the bands when you do this. In our raster stack, band 19, which is the 
blue band, is first in the stack, whereas band 58, which is the red band, is last. 
Thus the order for a RGB image is 3,2,1 to ensure the red band is rendered first 
as red. 

Thinking ahead to next time: If you know you want to create composite RGB images, 
think about the order of your rasters when you make the stack so the RGB=1,2,3. 

We will plot the raster with the `rgbRaster()` function and the need these 
following arguments: 

* R object to plot
* which layer of the stack is which color
* stretch: allows for increased contrast. Options are "lin" & "hist".

Let's try it. 

``` {r plot-rgb}
# plot an RGB version of the stack
plotRGB(rgbRaster,r=3,g=2,b=1, stretch = "lin")

```

Note: read the `raster` package documentation for other arguments that can be 
added (like `scale`) to improve or modify the image. 

## Explore Raster Values - Histograms

You can also explore the data. Histograms allow us to view the distrubiton of 
values in the pixels. 

``` {r hist}
# view histogram of reflectance values for all rasters
hist(rgbRaster)
```

Note about the warning messages: R defaults to only showing the first 100,000 
values in the histogram so if you have a large raster you may not be seeing all 
the values. This saves your from long waits, or crashing R, if you have large
datasets. 

## Crop Rasters

You can crop all rasters within a raster stack the same way you'd do it with a 
single raster. 

``` {r stack-crop}

# determine the desired extent
rgbCrop <- c(256770.7,256959,4112140,4112284)

# crop to desired extent
rgbRaster_crop <- crop(rgbRaster, rgbCrop)

# view cropped stack
plot(rgbRaster_crop)

```

 <div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Challenge: Plot Cropped RGB
Plot this new cropped stack as an RGB image. 
</div>

``` {r challenge-code-plot-crop-rgb, echo=FALSE}
# plot an RGB version of the cropped stack
plotRGB(rgbRaster_crop,r=3,g=2,b=1, stretch = "lin")

```



## Raster Bricks in R
In our `rgbRaster` object we have a list of rasters in a stack. These rasters 
are all the same extent, CRS and resolution. By creating a **raster brick** we 
will create one raster object that contains all of the rasters so that we can 
use this object to quickly create RGB images. Raster bricks are more efficient 
objects to use when processing larger datasets. This is because the computer 
doesn't have to spend energy finding the data - it is contained within the object.

``` {r create-r-brick}
# create raster brick
rgbBrick <- brick(rgbRaster)

# check attributes
rgbBrick

```

While the brick might seem similar to the stack (see attributes above), we can 
see that it's very different when we look at the size of the object.

* the brick contains **all of the data** stored in one object
* the stack contains links or references to the files stored on your computer

Use `object.size()` to see the size of an R object. 

``` {r rBrick-size}
# view object size
object.size(rgbBrick)
object.size(rgbRaster)

# view raster brick
plotRGB(rgbBrick,r=3,g=2,b=1, stretch = "Lin")
```

Notice the faster plotting? For a smaller raster like this the difference is 
slight, but for larger raster it can be considerable. 
	
## Write to GeoTIFF

We can write out the raster in GeoTIFF format as well. When we do this it will 
copy the CRS, extent and resolution information so the data will read properly 
into a GIS program as well. Note that this writes the raster in the order they 
are in. In our case, the blue (band 19) is first but most programs expect the 
red band first (RGB). 

One way around this is to generate a new raster stack with the rasters in the 
proper order - red, green and blue format. Or, just always create your stacks
R->G->B to start!!!

``` {r rgb-order-stack}
# Make a new stack in the order we want the data in 
orderRGBstack <- stack(rgbRaster$band58,rgbRaster$band34,rgbRaster$band19)

# write the geotiff
# change overwrite=TRUE to FALSE if you want to make sure you don't overwrite your files!
writeRaster(orderRGBstack,"rgbRaster.tif","GTiff", overwrite=TRUE)
```


## Import A Multi-Band Image into R
You can import a multi-band image into R too. To do this, you import the file as 
a stack rather than a raster (which brings in just one band). Let's import the 
raster than we just created above.

``` {r import-multi-raster}

# import multi-band raster as stack
multiRasterS <- stack("rgbRaster.tif") 

# import multi-band raster direct to brick
multiRasterB <- brick("rgbRaster.tif") 

# view raster
plot(multiRasterB)
plotRGB(multiRasterB,r=1,g=2,b=3, stretch="lin")
```
