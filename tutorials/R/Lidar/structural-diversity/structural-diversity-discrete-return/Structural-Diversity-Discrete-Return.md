## Introduction to Structural Diversity Metrics
Forest structure influences many important ecological processes, including 
biogeochemical cycling, wildfires, species richness and diversity, and many 
others. Quantifying forest structure, hereafter referred to as "structural 
diversity," presents a challenge for many reasons, including difficulty in 
measuring individual trees, limbs, and leaves across large areas. In order 
to overcome this challenge, today's researchers use Light Detection And 
Ranging (LiDAR) technology to measure large areas of forest. It is also 
challenging to calculate meaningful summary metrics of a forest's structure 
that 1) are ecologically relevant and 2) can be used to compare different 
forested locations. In this tutorial, you will be introduced to a few tools 
that will help you to explore and quantify forest structure using LiDAR data 
collected at two field sites of the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/" target="_blank"> 
National Ecological Observatory Network</a>. 

## NEON AOP Discrete Return LIDAR
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/airborne-remote-sensing" target="_blank"> The NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) </a>. 
has several sensors including discrete-return LiDAR, which is useful for measuring forest structural diversity that can be summarized into four categories of metrics: (1) canopy height, (2) canopy cover and openness, and (3) canopy heterogeneity (internal and external), and (4) vegetation area.

We will be comparing the structural diversity of two NEON sites that vary in their structural characteristics. 

First, we will look at <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV" target="_blank">Harvard Forest (HARV)</a>, which is located in Massachusetts. It is a lower elevation, mixed deciduous and evergreen forest dominated by Quercus rubra, Acer rubrum, and Aralia nudicaulis.

Second, we will look at <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/TEAK" target="_blank">Lower Teakettle (TEAK)</a>, which is a high elevation forested NEON site in California. TEAK is an evergreen forest dominated by Abies magnifica, Abies concolor, Pinus jeffreyi, and Pinus contorta. 

As you can imagine, these two forest types will have both similarities and differences in their structural attributes. We can quantify these attributes by calculating several different structural diversity metrics, and comparing 
the results.

## Loading the LIDAR Products
To begin, we first need to load our required R packages, and set our working 
directory to the location where we saved the input LiDAR .laz files that can be 
downloaded from the NEON Data Portal.


    ############### Packages ################### 
    library(lidR)

    ## lidR 3.0.3 using 1 threads. Help on <gis.stackexchange.com>. Bug report on <github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR>.

    library(gstat)
    
    ############### Set working directory ######
    #set the working of the downloaded tutorial folder
    wd <- "~/Git/data/" #This will depend on your local machine
    setwd(wd)

Next, we will read in the LiDAR data using the `lidR::readLAS()` function. 
Note that this function can read in both `.las` and `.laz` file formats.


    ############ Read in LiDAR data ###########
    #2017 1 km2 tile .laz file type for HARV and TEAK
    
    #Watch out for outlier Z points - this function also allows for the
    #ability to filter outlier points well above or below the landscape
    #(-drop_z_blow and -drop_z_above). See how we have done this here 
    #for you.
    
    HARV <- readLAS(paste0(wd,"NEON_D01_HARV_DP1_727000_4702000_classified_point_cloud_colorized.laz"),
                    filter = "-drop_z_below 150 -drop_z_above 325")
    
    TEAK <- readLAS(paste0(wd,"NEON_D17_TEAK_DP1_316000_4091000_classified_point_cloud_colorized.laz"),
                    filter = "-drop_z_below 1694 -drop_z_above 2500")

## Normalizing Tree Height to Ground
To begin, we will take a look at the structural diversity of the dense mixed deciduous/evergreen 
forest of HARV. We're going to choose a 40 x 40 m spatial extent for our analysis, but first we 
need to normalize the height values of this LiDAR point cloud from an absolute elevation 
above mean sea level to height above the ground using the `lidR::lasnormalize()` function. This 
function relies on spatial interpolation, and therefore we want to perform this step on an area 
that is quite a bit larger than our area of interest to avoid edge effects. To be safe, we will 
clip out an area of 200 x 200 m, normalize it, and then clip out our smaller area of interest.


    ############## Correct for elevation #####
    #We're going to choose a 40 x 40 m spatial extent, which is the
    #extent for NEON base plots. 
    #First set the center of where you want the plot to be (note easting 
    #and northing works in units of m because these data are in a UTM 
    #proejction as shown in the summary above).
    x <- 727500 #easting 
    y <- 4702500 #northing
    
    #Cut out a 200 x 200 m buffer by adding 100 m to easting and 
    #northing coordinates (x,y).
    data.200m <- 
       lasclipRectangle(HARV,
                        xleft = (x - 100), ybottom = (y - 100),
                        xright = (x + 100), ytop = (y + 100))
    
    #Correct for ground height using a kriging function to interpolate 
    #elevation from ground points in the .laz file.
    #If the function will not run, then you may need to checkfor outliers
    #by adjusting the 'drop_z_' arguments when reading in the .laz files.
    dtm <- grid_terrain(data.200m, 1, kriging(k = 10L))

    ## Warning: There were 7 degenerated ground points. Some X Y coordinates
    ## were repeated but with different Z coordinates. min Z were retained.

    data.200m <- lasnormalize(data.200m, dtm)
    
    #Will often give a warning if not all points could be corrected, 
    #but visually check to see if it corrected for ground height. 
    plot(data.200m)
    #There's only a few uncorrected points and we'll fix these in 
    #the next step. 
    
    #Clip 20 m out from each side of the easting and northing 
    #coordinates (x,y).
    data.40m <- 
       lasclipRectangle(data.200m, 
                        xleft = (x - 20), ybottom = (y - 20),
                        xright = (x + 20), ytop = (y + 20))
    
    data.40m@data$Z[data.40m@data$Z <= .5] <- NA  
    #This line filters out all z_vals below .5 m as we are less 
    #interested in shrubs/trees. 
    #You could change it to zero or another height depending on interests. 
    
    #visualize the clipped plot point cloud
    plot(data.40m)

## Calculating Structural Diversity Metrics
Now that we have our area of interest normalized and clipped, we can proceed with calculating 
our structural diversity metrics.

## Combining Everything Into One Function
Now that we have run through how to measure each structural diversity metric, let's create a 
convenient function to run these a little faster on the TEAK site for a comparison of structural 
diversity with HARV.

## Comparing Metrics Between Forests
How does the structural diversity of the evergreen TEAK forest compare to the mixed deciduous/evergreen forest from HARV? Let's combine the result data.frames for a direct comparison:
