## Get Started 
In this tutorial, we are working with the same set of rasters used in the
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/dc-raster-time-series-r" target="_blank"> *Raster Time Series Data in R* </a>
tutorial. These data are derived from the Landsat satellite and stored in 
`GeoTIFF` format. Each raster covers the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV" target="_blank">NEON Harvard Forest field site</a>.  

If you have not already created the RasterStack, originally created in 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/dc-raster-time-series-r" target="_blank"> *Raster Time Series Data in R* </a>,
please create it now. 

```{r load-libraries-data }
# import libraries
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(rasterVis)
library(RColorBrewer)

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import
wd <- "~/Git/data/" # this will depend on your local environment environment
# be sure that the downloaded file is in this directory
setwd(wd)

# Create list of NDVI file paths
all_NDVI_HARV <- list.files(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/NDVI"), full.names = TRUE, pattern = ".tif$")

# Create a time series raster stack
NDVI_HARV_stack <- stack(all_NDVI_HARV)

# apply scale factor
NDVI_HARV_stack <- NDVI_HARV_stack/10000

```

## Plot Raster Time Series Data
We can use the `plot` function to plot our raster time series data.

```{r plot-time-series, fig.cap="Plot of all the NDVI rasters for NEON's site Harvard Forest"}
# view a plot of all of the rasters
# nc specifies number of columns
plot(NDVI_HARV_stack, nc = 4)

``` 

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** The range of values for NDVI is 0-1. 
However, the data stored in our raster ranges from 0 - 10,000. If we view the 
metadata for the original .tif files, we will see a scale factor of 10,000 is
defined.
Multiplying values with decimal places by a factor of 10, allows the data to be 
stored in integer format (no decimals) rather than a floating point format 
(containing decimals). This keeps the file size smaller. 
</div>

Our plot is nice however, it's missing some key elements including, easily
readable titles. It also contains a legend that is repeated for each image. We
can use `levelplot` from the `rasterVis` package to make our plot prettier! 

* <a href="http://oscarperpinan.github.io/rastervis/" target="_blank">More on
the `rasterVis` package</a>

The syntax for the `levelplot()` function is similar to that for the `plot()`
function. We use `main="TITLE"` to add a title to the entire plot series.

```{r levelplot-time-series, fig.cap="Levelplot of all the NDVI rasters for NEON's site Harvard Forest"}
# create a `levelplot` plot
levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
          main="Landsat NDVI\nNEON Harvard Forest")

```

## Adjust the Color Ramp
Next, let's adjust the color ramp used to render the rasters. First, we
can change the red color ramp to a green one that is more visually suited to our 
NDVI (greenness) data using the `colorRampPalette()` function in combination with 
`colorBrewer`. 

```{r change-color-ramp, fig.cap="Levelplot of all the NDVI rasters for NEON's site Harvard Forest with a new color palette"}
# use colorbrewer which loads with the rasterVis package to generate
# a color ramp of yellow to green
cols <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9,"YlGn"))
# create a level plot - plot
levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
        main="Landsat NDVI -- Improved Colors \nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
        col.regions=cols)

```

The yellow to green color ramp visually represents NDVI well given it's a
measure of greenness. Someone looking at the plot can quickly understand that
pixels that are more green, have a higher NDVI value.

## Refine Plot & Tile Labels
Next, let's label each raster in our plot with the Julian day that the raster
represents. The current names come from the band (layer names) stored in the
`RasterStack` and first the part each name is the Julian day. 

To create a more meaningful label we can remove the "x" and replace it with
"day" using the `gsub()` function in R. The syntax is as follows:
`gsub("StringToReplace","TextToReplaceIt", Robject)`. 

First let's remove "_HARV_NDVI_crop" from each label. 

```{r clean-up-names }

# view names for each raster layer
names(NDVI_HARV_stack)

# use gsub to modify label names.that we'll use for the plot 
rasterNames  <- gsub("X","Day ", names(NDVI_HARV_stack))

# view Names
rasterNames

# Remove HARV_NDVI_crop from the second part of the string 
rasterNames  <- gsub("_HARV_ndvi_crop","",rasterNames)

# view names for each raster layer
rasterNames
```

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Instead of substituting "x" and
"_HARV_NDVI_crop" separately, we could have used use the vertical bar character 
( | ) to replace more than one element.
For example "X|_HARV" tells R to replace all instances of both "X" and "_HARV"
in the string. Example code to remove "x" an "_HARV...":
`gsub("X|_HARV_NDVI_crop"," |  ","rasterNames")` 
</div>

Once the names for each band have been reassigned, we can render our plot with
the new labels using `names.attr=rasterNames`. 

```{r create-levelplot, fig.cap="Levelplot of all the NDVI rasters for NEON's site Harvard Forest with a legend, a 4x4layout, and each raster labeled with the Julian Day"}

# use level plot to create a nice plot with one legend and a 4x4 layout.
levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
          layout=c(4, 4), # create a 4x4 layout for the data
          col.regions=cols, # add a color ramp
          main="Landsat NDVI - Julian Days \nHarvard Forest 2011",
          names.attr=rasterNames)

```

We can adjust the columns of our plot too using `layout=c(cols,rows)`. Below
we adjust the layout to be a matrix of 5 columns and 3 rows.

```{r adjust-layout, fig.cap="Levelplot of all the NDVI rasters for NEON's site Harvard Forest with a legend, a 5x3 layout, and each raster labeled with the Julian Day"}
# use level plot to create a nice plot with one legend and a 4x4 layout.
levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
          layout=c(5, 3), # create a 5x3 layout for the data
          col.regions=cols, # add a color ramp
          main="Landsat NDVI - Julian Days \nHarvard Forest 2011",
          names.attr=rasterNames)
```

Finally, `scales` allows us to modify the x and y-axis scale. Let's simply
remove the axis ticks from the plot with `scales =list(draw=FALSE)`.

```{r remove-axis-ticks, fig.cap="Levelplot of all the NDVI rasters for NEON's site Harvard Forest with a legend, no axes, and each raster labeled with the Julian Day"}
# use level plot to create a nice plot with one legend and a 4x4 layout.
levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
          layout=c(5, 3), # create a 5x3 layout for the data
          col.regions=cols, # add a color ramp
          main="Landsat NDVI - Julian Days \nHarvard Forest 2011",
          names.attr=rasterNames,
          scales=list(draw=FALSE )) # remove axes labels & ticks
```

### Challenge: Divergent Color Ramps 
When we used `gsub` to modify the tile labels we replaced the beginning of each 
tile title with "Day". A more descriptive name could be "Julian Day".

1. Create a plot and label each tile "Julian Day" with the julian day value
following.
2. Change the colorramp to a divergent brown to green color ramp to
represent the data. *Hint:* Use the 
<a href="http://www.datavis.ca/sasmac/brewerpal.html" target="_blank"> brewerpal page</a>
to help choose a color ramp. 

**Questions:**
Does having a divergent color ramp represent the data
better than a sequential color ramp (like "YlGn")? Can you think of other data
sets where a divergent color ramp may be best? 
</div>

```{r challenge-code-levelplot-divergent, fig.cap="Levelplot of all the NDVI rasters for NEON's site Harvard Forest with a legend, a 5x3 layout, a divergent color palette, and each raster labeled with the Julian Day", echo=FALSE }
# change Day to Julian Day 
rasterNames  <- gsub("Day","Julian Day ", rasterNames)

# use level plot to create a nice plot with one legend and a 5x3 layout.
levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
      layout=c(5, 3), # create a 4x3 layout for the data
      col.regions=colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9, "BrBG")), # specify color 
      main="Landsat NDVI - Julian Days - 2011 \nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
      names.attr=rasterNames)

# The sequential is better than the divergent as it is more akin to the process
# of greening up, which starts off at one end and just keeps increasing. 

```
