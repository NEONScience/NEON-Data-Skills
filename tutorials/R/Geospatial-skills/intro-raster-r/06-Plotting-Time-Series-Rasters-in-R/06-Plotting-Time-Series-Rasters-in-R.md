    # apply scale factor
    NDVI_HARV_stack <- NDVI_HARV_stack/10000

## Plot Raster Time Series Data
We can use the `plot` function to plot our raster time series data.


    # view a plot of all of the rasters
    # nc specifies number of columns
    plot(NDVI_HARV_stack, nc = 4)

![Plot of all the NDVI rasters for NEON's site Harvard Forest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/Geospatial-skills/intro-raster-r/06-Plotting-Time-Series-Rasters-in-R/rfigs/plot-time-series-1.png)

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** The range of values for NDVI is 0-1. 
However, the data stored in our raster ranges from 0 - 10,000. If we view the 
metadata for the original .tif files, we will see a scale factor of 10,000 is
defined.
Multiplying values with decimal places by a factor of 10, allows the data to be 
stored in integer format (no decimals) rather than a floating point format 
(containing decimals). This keeps the file size smaller. 
</div>

Our plot is nice however, it's missing some key elements including, easily
readable titles. It also contains a legend that is repeated for each image. We
can use `levelplot` from the `rasterVis` package to make our plot prettier! 

* <a href="http://oscarperpinan.github.io/rastervis/" target="_blank">More on
the `rasterVis` package</a>

The syntax for the `levelplot()` function is similar to that for the `plot()`
function. We use `main="TITLE"` to add a title to the entire plot series.


    # create a `levelplot` plot
    levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
              main="Landsat NDVI\nNEON Harvard Forest")

![Levelplot of all the NDVI rasters for NEON's site Harvard Forest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/Geospatial-skills/intro-raster-r/06-Plotting-Time-Series-Rasters-in-R/rfigs/levelplot-time-series-1.png)

## Adjust the Color Ramp
Next, let's adjust the color ramp used to render the rasters. First, we
can change the red color ramp to a green one that is more visually suited to our 
NDVI (greenness) data using the `colorRampPalette()` function in combination with 
`colorBrewer`. 


    # use colorbrewer which loads with the rasterVis package to generate
    # a color ramp of yellow to green
    cols <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9,"YlGn"))
    # create a level plot - plot
    levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
            main="Landsat NDVI -- Improved Colors \nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
            col.regions=cols)

![Levelplot of all the NDVI rasters for NEON's site Harvard Forest with a new color palette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/Geospatial-skills/intro-raster-r/06-Plotting-Time-Series-Rasters-in-R/rfigs/change-color-ramp-1.png)

The yellow to green color ramp visually represents NDVI well given it's a
measure of greenness. Someone looking at the plot can quickly understand that
pixels that are more green, have a higher NDVI value.

## Refine Plot & Tile Labels
Next, let's label each raster in our plot with the Julian day that the raster
represents. The current names come from the band (layer names) stored in the
`RasterStack` and first the part each name is the Julian day. 

To create a more meaningful label we can remove the "x" and replace it with
"day" using the `gsub()` function in R. The syntax is as follows:
`gsub("StringToReplace","TextToReplaceIt", Robject)`. 

First let's remove "_HARV_NDVI_crop" from each label. 


    # view names for each raster layer
    names(NDVI_HARV_stack)

    ##  [1] "X005_HARV_ndvi_crop" "X037_HARV_ndvi_crop" "X085_HARV_ndvi_crop"
    ##  [4] "X133_HARV_ndvi_crop" "X181_HARV_ndvi_crop" "X197_HARV_ndvi_crop"
    ##  [7] "X213_HARV_ndvi_crop" "X229_HARV_ndvi_crop" "X245_HARV_ndvi_crop"
    ## [10] "X261_HARV_ndvi_crop" "X277_HARV_ndvi_crop" "X293_HARV_ndvi_crop"
    ## [13] "X309_HARV_ndvi_crop"

    # use gsub to modify label names.that we'll use for the plot 
    rasterNames  <- gsub("X","Day ", names(NDVI_HARV_stack))
    
    # view Names
    rasterNames

    ##  [1] "Day 005_HARV_ndvi_crop" "Day 037_HARV_ndvi_crop"
    ##  [3] "Day 085_HARV_ndvi_crop" "Day 133_HARV_ndvi_crop"
    ##  [5] "Day 181_HARV_ndvi_crop" "Day 197_HARV_ndvi_crop"
    ##  [7] "Day 213_HARV_ndvi_crop" "Day 229_HARV_ndvi_crop"
    ##  [9] "Day 245_HARV_ndvi_crop" "Day 261_HARV_ndvi_crop"
    ## [11] "Day 277_HARV_ndvi_crop" "Day 293_HARV_ndvi_crop"
    ## [13] "Day 309_HARV_ndvi_crop"

    # Remove HARV_NDVI_crop from the second part of the string 
    rasterNames  <- gsub("_HARV_ndvi_crop","",rasterNames)
    
    # view names for each raster layer
    rasterNames

    ##  [1] "Day 005" "Day 037" "Day 085" "Day 133" "Day 181" "Day 197"
    ##  [7] "Day 213" "Day 229" "Day 245" "Day 261" "Day 277" "Day 293"
    ## [13] "Day 309"

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Instead of substituting "x" and
"_HARV_NDVI_crop" separately, we could have used use the vertical bar character 
( | ) to replace more than one element.
For example "X|_HARV" tells R to replace all instances of both "X" and "_HARV"
in the string. Example code to remove "x" an "_HARV...":
`gsub("X|_HARV_NDVI_crop"," |  ","rasterNames")` 
</div>

Once the names for each band have been reassigned, we can render our plot with
the new labels using `names.attr=rasterNames`. 


    # use level plot to create a nice plot with one legend and a 4x4 layout.
    levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
              layout=c(4, 4), # create a 4x4 layout for the data
              col.regions=cols, # add a color ramp
              main="Landsat NDVI - Julian Days \nHarvard Forest 2011",
              names.attr=rasterNames)

![Levelplot of all the NDVI rasters for NEON's site Harvard Forest with a legend, a 4x4layout, and each raster labeled with the Julian Day](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/Geospatial-skills/intro-raster-r/06-Plotting-Time-Series-Rasters-in-R/rfigs/create-levelplot-1.png)

We can adjust the columns of our plot too using `layout=c(cols,rows)`. Below
we adjust the layout to be a matrix of 5 columns and 3 rows.


    # use level plot to create a nice plot with one legend and a 4x4 layout.
    levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
              layout=c(5, 3), # create a 5x3 layout for the data
              col.regions=cols, # add a color ramp
              main="Landsat NDVI - Julian Days \nHarvard Forest 2011",
              names.attr=rasterNames)

![Levelplot of all the NDVI rasters for NEON's site Harvard Forest with a legend, a 5x3 layout, and each raster labeled with the Julian Day](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/Geospatial-skills/intro-raster-r/06-Plotting-Time-Series-Rasters-in-R/rfigs/adjust-layout-1.png)

Finally, `scales` allows us to modify the x and y-axis scale. Let's simply
remove the axis ticks from the plot with `scales =list(draw=FALSE)`.


    # use level plot to create a nice plot with one legend and a 4x4 layout.
    levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
              layout=c(5, 3), # create a 5x3 layout for the data
              col.regions=cols, # add a color ramp
              main="Landsat NDVI - Julian Days \nHarvard Forest 2011",
              names.attr=rasterNames,
              scales=list(draw=FALSE )) # remove axes labels & ticks

![Levelplot of all the NDVI rasters for NEON's site Harvard Forest with a legend, no axes, and each raster labeled with the Julian Day](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/Geospatial-skills/intro-raster-r/06-Plotting-Time-Series-Rasters-in-R/rfigs/remove-axis-ticks-1.png)

### Challenge: Divergent Color Ramps 
When we used `gsub` to modify the tile labels we replaced the beginning of each 
tile title with "Day". A more descriptive name could be "Julian Day".

1. Create a plot and label each tile "Julian Day" with the julian day value
following.
2. Change the colorramp to a divergent brown to green color ramp to
represent the data. *Hint:* Use the 
<a href="http://www.datavis.ca/sasmac/brewerpal.html" target="_blank"> brewerpal page</a>
to help choose a color ramp. 

**Questions:**
Does having a divergent color ramp represent the data
better than a sequential color ramp (like "YlGn")? Can you think of other data
sets where a divergent color ramp may be best?
