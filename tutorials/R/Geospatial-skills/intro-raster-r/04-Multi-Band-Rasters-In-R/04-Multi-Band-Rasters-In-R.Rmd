## About Raster Bands in R 
As discussed in the
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/dc-raster-data-r" target="_blank"> *Intro to Raster Data* tutorial</a>, 
a raster can contain 1 or more bands.

    raster.  Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).</figcaption>
</figure>

To work with multi-band rasters in R, we need to change how we import and plot
our data in several ways. 

* To import multi band raster data we will use the `stack()` function.
* If our multi-band data are imagery that we wish to composite, we can use
`plotRGB()` (instead of `plot()`) to plot a 3 band raster image.

## About Multi-Band Imagery
One type of multi-band raster dataset that is familiar to many of us is a color 
image. A basic color image consists of three bands: red, green, and blue. Each
band represents light reflected from the red, green or blue portions of the
electromagnetic spectrum. The pixel brightness for each band, when composited
creates the colors that we see in an image.

## Getting Started with Multi-Band Data in R
To work with multi-band raster data we will use the `raster` and `rgdal`
packages.

```{r load-libraries }

# work with raster data
library(raster)
# export GeoTIFFs and other core GIS functions
library(rgdal)

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import
wd <- "~/Git/data/" # this will depend on your local environment environment
# be sure that the downloaded file is in this directory
setwd(wd)

```

In this tutorial, the multi-band data that we are working with is imagery
collected using the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/airborne-remote-sensing" target="_blank">NEON Airborne Observation Platform</a>
high resolution camera over the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV" target="_blank">NEON Harvard Forest field site</a>. 
Each RGB image is a 3-band raster. The same steps would apply to 
working with a multi-spectral image with 4 or more bands - like Landsat imagery.
We can plot each band of a multi-band image individually. 

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** In many GIS applications, a single band 
would render as a single image in grayscale. We will therefore use a grayscale 
palette to render individual bands. 
</div>

```{r demonstrate-RGB-Image, fig.cap="Red, green, and blue bands of NEON's site Harvard Forest", echo=FALSE}
# Use stack function to read in all bands
RGB_stack_HARV <- 
  stack(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif"))

names(RGB_stack_HARV) <- c("Red Band","Green Band","Blue Band")

grayscale_colors <- gray.colors(100, 
                                start = 0.0, 
                                end = 1.0, 
                                gamma = 2.2, 
                                alpha = NULL)

# Create an RGB image from the raster stack
plot(RGB_stack_HARV, 
     col=grayscale_colors,
     axes=F)

```

Or we can composite all three bands together to make a color image.

```{r plot-RGB-now, fig.cap="Composite image of NEON's site Harvard Forest", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Create an RGB image from the raster stack

original_par <-par() # create original par for easy reversal at end
par(col.axis="white",col.lab="white",tck=0)
plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV, r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
        axes=TRUE, 
        main="3 Band Color Composite Image\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
box(col="white")

```

In a multi-band dataset, the rasters will always have the same *extent*,
*CRS* and *resolution*.  

```{r reset-par, echo=FALSE, results="hide", warning=FALSE}
par(original_par) # go back to original par

```

If we read a `rasterStack` into R using the `raster()` function, it only reads
in the first band. We can plot this band using the plot function. 

```{r read-single-band, fig.cap="Red band of NEON's site Harvard Forest"}
 
# Read in multi-band raster with raster function. 
# Default is the first band only.
RGB_band1_HARV <- 
  raster(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif"))

# create a grayscale color palette to use for the image.
grayscale_colors <- gray.colors(100,            # number of different color levels 
                                start = 0.0,    # how black (0) to go
                                end = 1.0,      # how white (1) to go
                                gamma = 2.2,    # correction between how a digital 
                                # camera sees the world and how human eyes see it
                                alpha = NULL)   #Null=colors are not transparent

# Plot band 1
plot(RGB_band1_HARV, 
     col=grayscale_colors, 
     axes=FALSE,
     main="RGB Imagery - Band 1-Red\nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site") 

# view attributes: Check out dimension, CRS, resolution, values attributes, and 
# band.
RGB_band1_HARV
```

Notice that when we look at the attributes of RGB_Band1, we see :

`band: 1  (of  3  bands)`

This is R telling us that this particular raster object has more bands (3)
associated with it.

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** The number of bands associated with a 
raster object can also be determined using the `nbands` slot. Syntax is 
`ObjectName@file@nbands`, or specifically for our file: `RGB_band1_HARV@file@nbands`.
</div>

### Image Raster Data Values
Let's next examine the raster's min and max values. What is the value range?

```{r min-max-image }
# view min value
minValue(RGB_band1_HARV)

# view max value
maxValue(RGB_band1_HARV)
```

This raster contains values between 0 and 255. These values 
represent degrees of brightness associated with the image band. In 
the case of a RGB image (red, green and blue), band 1 is the red band. When
we plot the red band, larger numbers (towards 255) represent pixels with more
red in them (a strong red reflection). Smaller numbers (towards 0) represent
pixels with less red in them (less red was reflected). To 
plot an RGB image, we mix red + green + blue values into one single color to
create a full color image - similar to the color image a digital camera creates.

### Import A Specific Band
We can use the `raster()` function to import specific bands in our raster object
by specifying which band we want with `band=N` (N represents the band number we
want to work with). To import the green band, we would use `band=2`.

```{r read-specific-band, fig.cap="Green band of NEON's site Harvard Forest"}
# Can specify which band we want to read in
RGB_band2_HARV <- 
  raster(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif"), 
           band = 2)

# plot band 2
plot(RGB_band2_HARV,
     col=grayscale_colors, # we already created this palette & can use it again
     axes=FALSE,
     main="RGB Imagery - Band 2- Green\nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site")

# view attributes of band 2 
RGB_band2_HARV

```

Notice that band 2 is the second of 3 bands `band: 2  (of  3  bands)`.  

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
### Challenge: Making Sense of Single Band Images
Compare the plots of band 1 (red) and band 2 (green). Is the forested area
darker or lighter in band 2 (the green band) compared to band 1 (the red band)?  
</div>

```{r challenge1-answer, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE }

# We'd expect a *brighter* value for the forest in band 2 (green) than in 
# band 1 (red) because the leaves on trees of most often appear "green" - 
# healthy leaves reflect MORE green light compared to red light 

```

## Other Types of Multi-band Raster Data

Multi-band raster data might also contain:

1. **Time series:** the same variable, over the same area, over time. Check out 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/dc-raster-time-series-r" target="_blank"> *Raster Time Series Data in R* tutorial </a>
to learn more about time series stacks.
2. **Multi or hyperspectral imagery:** image rasters that have 4 or more
(multi-spectral) or more than 10-15 (hyperspectral) bands. Check out the NEON
Data Skills
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/hsi-hdf5-r" target="_blank"> **Imaging Spectroscopy HDF5 in R** tutorial</a> 
tutorial for more about working with hyperspectral data cubes.

## Raster Stacks in R
Next, we will work with all three image bands (red, green and blue) as an R
`RasterStack` object. We will then plot a 3-band composite, or full color,
image. 

To bring in all bands of a multi-band raster, we use the`stack()` function.

```{r intro-to-raster-stacks }

# Use stack function to read in all bands
RGB_stack_HARV <- 
  stack(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif"))

# view attributes of stack object
RGB_stack_HARV

```

We can view the attributes of each band the stack using `RGB_stack_HARV@layers`.
Or we if we have hundreds of bands, we can specify which band we'd like to view 
attributes for using an index value: `RGB_stack_HARV[[1]]`. We can also use the
 `plot()` and `hist()` functions on the `RasterStack` to plot and view the
 distribution of raster band values.

```{r plot-raster-layers, fig.cap=c("Histograms of each RGB band showing the distribution of values for NEON's site Harvard Forest","Raster of each RGB band for NEON's site Harvard Forest","Band 2 of NEON's site Harvard Forest")}
# view raster attributes
RGB_stack_HARV@layers

# view attributes for one band
RGB_stack_HARV[[1]]

# view histogram of all 3 bands
hist(RGB_stack_HARV,
     maxpixels=ncell(RGB_stack_HARV))

# plot all three bands separately
plot(RGB_stack_HARV, 
     col=grayscale_colors)

# revert to a single plot layout 
par(mfrow=c(1,1)) 

# plot band 2 
plot(RGB_stack_HARV[[2]], 
     main="Band 2\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
     col=grayscale_colors)

```


### Create A Three Band Image
To render a final 3 band, color image in R, we use `plotRGB()`.

This function allows us to:

1. Identify what bands we want to render in the red, green and blue regions. The 
`plotRGB()` function defaults to a 1=red, 2=green, and 3=blue band order. However, 
you can define what bands you'd like to plot manually. Manual definition of
bands is useful if you have, for example a near-infrared band and want to create
a color infrared image.
2. Adjust the `stretch` of the image to increase or decrease contrast.

Let's plot our 3-band image.

```{r plot-rgb-image, fig.cap="Composite RGB image of NEON's site Harvard Forest"}

# Create an RGB image from the raster stack
plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV, 
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3)

```

The image above looks pretty good. We can explore whether applying a stretch to
the image might improve clarity and contrast using  `stretch="lin"` or 
`stretch="hist"`.  

<figure>
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/raster-general/imageStretch_dark.jpg">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/raster-general/imageStretch_dark.jpg"
    alt="Graphic depicting stretching pixel brightness values to make a dark satellite image brighter">
    </a>
    <figcaption>When the range of pixel brightness values is closer to 0, a
    darker image is rendered by default. We can stretch the values to extend to
    the full 0-255 range of potential values to increase the visual contrast of
    the image.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/raster-general/imageStretch_light.jpg">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/raster-general/imageStretch_light.jpg"
    alt="Graphic depicting stretching pixel brightness values to make a bright satellite image darker">
    </a>
    <figcaption>When the range of pixel brightness values is closer to 255, a
    lighter image is rendered by default. We can stretch the values to extend to
    the full 0-255 range of potential values to increase the visual contrast of
    the image.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

```{r image-stretch, fig.cap=c("Composite RGB image of NEON's site Harvard Forest", "Composite RGB image of NEON's site Harvard Forest with slightly more contrast")}

# what does stretch do?
plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3, 
        scale=800,
        stretch = "lin")

plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3, 
        scale=800,
        stretch = "hist")

```

In this case, the stretch doesn't enhance the contrast our image significantly
given the distribution of reflectance (or brightness) values is distributed well
between 0 and 255.

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
## Challenge - NoData Values
Let's explore what happens with NoData values when using `RasterStack` and
`plotRGB`. We will use the `HARV_Ortho_wNA.tif` GeoTIFF in the
`NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARVRGB_Imagery/` directory.

1. View the files attributes. Are there `NoData` values assigned for this file? 
2. If so, what is the `NoData` Value? 
3. How many bands does it have?
4. Open the multi-band raster file in R. 
5. Plot the object as a true color image. 
6. What happened to the black edges in the data?
7. What does this tell us about the difference in the data structure between  
`HARV_Ortho_wNA.tif` and `HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif` (R object `RGB_stack`). How can
you check?

Answer the questions above using the functions we have covered so far in this
tutorial.

</div>

``` {r challenge-code-NoData, fig.cap="Composite RGB image of NEON's site Harvard Forest with NAvalues removed", echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
# 1.
# view attributes
GDALinfo(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_Ortho_wNA.tif"))

# 2 Yes it has NoData values as they are assigned as -9999 
# 3 3 bands

# 4
# reading in file
HARV_NA<- 
  stack(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_Ortho_wNA.tif"))

# 5
plotRGB(HARV_NA, 
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3)

#6 The black edges are not plotted. 
#7 Both have NoData values, however, in RGB_stack the NoData value is not
# defined in the tiff tags, thus R renders them as black as the reflectance
# values are 0. The black edges in the other file are defined as -9999 and R
# renders them as NA.
GDALinfo(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif"))

```

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** We can create a RasterStack from 
several, individual single-band GeoTIFFs too. Check out:

</div>

## RasterStack vs RasterBrick in R

The R `RasterStack` and `RasterBrick` object types can both store multiple bands.
However, how they store each band is different. The bands in a `RasterStack` are
stored as links to raster data that is located somewhere on our computer. A 
`RasterBrick` contains all of the objects stored within the actual R object.
In most cases, we can work with a `RasterBrick` in the same way we might work
with a `RasterStack`. However a `RasterBrick` is often more efficient and faster
to process - which is important when working with larger files.


We can turn a `RasterStack` into a `RasterBrick` in R by using
`brick(StackName)`. Let's use the `object.size()` function to compare `stack` 
and `brick` R objects.

```{r raster-bricks, fig.cap="Composite RGB image of NEON's site Harvard Forest"}

# view size of the RGB_stack object that contains our 3 band image
object.size(RGB_stack_HARV)

# convert stack to a brick
RGB_brick_HARV <- brick(RGB_stack_HARV)

# view size of the brick
object.size(RGB_brick_HARV)

```

Notice that in the `RasterBrick`, all of the bands are stored within the actual 
object. Thus, the `RasterBrick` object size is much larger than the
`RasterStack` object. 

You use `plotRGB` to block a `RasterBrick` too. 

``` {r plot-brick}
# plot brick
plotRGB(RGB_brick_HARV)

```

### Challenge: What Methods Can Be Used on an R Object?
We can view various methods available to call on an R object with 
`methods(class=class(objectNameHere))`. Use this to figure out:

1. What methods can be used to call on the `RGB_stack_HARV` object? 
2. What methods are available for a single band within `RGB_stack_HARV`? 
3. Why do you think there is a difference?
