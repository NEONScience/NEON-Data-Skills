## About Raster Bands in R 
As discussed in the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/dc-raster-data-r" target="_blank"> *Intro to Raster Data* tutorial</a>, 
a raster can contain 1 or more bands.

    raster. Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).</figcaption>
</figure>

To work with multiband rasters in R, we need to change how we import and plot our data in several ways. 

* To import multiband raster data we will use the `stack()` function.
* If our multiband data are imagery that we wish to composite, we can use `plotRGB()` (instead of `plot()`) to plot a 3 band raster image.

## About MultiBand Imagery
One type of multiband raster dataset that is familiar to many of us is a color image. A basic color image consists of three bands: red, green, and blue. Each band represents light reflected from the red, green or blue portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The pixel brightness for each band, when composited creates the colors that we see in an image.

## Getting Started with Multi-Band Data in R
To work with multiband raster data we will use the `terra` package.

```{r load-libraries }

# terra package to work with raster data
library(terra)

# package for downloading NEON data
library(neonUtilities)

# package for specifying color palettes
library(RColorBrewer)

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import
wd <- "~/data/" # this will depend on your local environment environment
# be sure that the downloaded file is in this directory
setwd(wd)

```

In this tutorial, the multi-band data that we are working with is imagery collected using the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/airborne-remote-sensing" target="_blank">NEON Airborne Observation Platform</a>
high resolution camera over the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV" target="_blank">NEON Harvard Forest field site</a>. Each RGB image is a 3-band raster. The same steps would apply to working with a multi-spectral image with 4 or more bands - like Landsat imagery, or even hyperspectral imagery (in geotiff format). We can plot each band of a multi-band image individually. 


```{r download-harv-camera-data}

byTileAOP(dpID='DP3.30010.001', # rgb camera data
          site='HARV',
          year='2022',
          easting=732000,
          northing=4713500,
          check.size=FALSE, # set to TRUE or remove if you want to check the size before downloading
          savepath = wd)

```

```{r demonstrate-RGB-Image, fig.cap="Red, green, and blue composite (true color) image of NEON's Harvard Forest (HARV) site", echo=FALSE}

# read the file as a raster
rgb_harv_file <- paste0(wd, "DP3.30010.001/neon-aop-products/2022/FullSite/D01/2022_HARV_7/L3/Camera/Mosaic/2022_HARV_7_732000_4713000_image.tif")
RGB_HARV <- rast(rgb_harv_file)

# Create an RGB image from the raster using the terra "plot" function. Note "plot" shows the same image, since there are 3 bands
plotRGB(RGB_HARV, axes=F)
# plot(RGB_HARV, axes=F) < this gives the same result as plotRGB

```

Or we can plot each bands separately as follows:

```{r plot-bands, fig.cap=c("Red band", "Green band", "Blue band")}

# Determine the number of bands
num_bands <- nlyr(RGB_HARV)

# Define colors to plot each
# Define color palettes for each band using RColorBrewer
colors <- list(
  brewer.pal(9, "Reds"),
  brewer.pal(9, "Greens"),
  brewer.pal(9, "Blues")
)

# Plot each band in a loop, with the specified colors
for (i in 1:num_bands) {
  plot(RGB_HARV[[i]], main=paste("Band", i), col=colors[[i]])
}
```

### Image Raster Data Attributes

We can display some of the attributes about the raster, as shown below:

``` {r raster-attributes}
# Print dimensions
cat("Dimensions:\n")
cat("Number of rows:", nrow(RGB_HARV), "\n")
cat("Number of columns:", ncol(RGB_HARV), "\n")
cat("Number of layers:", nlyr(RGB_HARV), "\n")

# Print resolution
resolutions <- res(RGB_HARV)
cat("Resolution:\n")
cat("X resolution:", resolutions[1], "\n")
cat("Y resolution:", resolutions[2], "\n")

# Get the extent of the raster
rgb_extent <- ext(RGB_HARV)

# Convert the extent to a string with rounded values
extent_str <- sprintf("xmin: %d, xmax: %d, ymin: %d, ymax: %d", 
                      round(xmin(rgb_extent)), 
                      round(xmax(rgb_extent)), 
                      round(ymin(rgb_extent)), 
                      round(ymax(rgb_extent)))

# Print the extent string
cat("Extent of the raster: \n")
cat(extent_str, "\n")

```
Let's take a look at the coordinate reference system, or CRS. You can use the parameters `describe=TRUE` to display this information more succinctly.

``` {r print-CRS}
crs(RGB_HARV, describe=TRUE)
```

Let's next examine the raster's minimum and maximum values. What is the range of values for each band?

```{r min-max-image }

# Replace Inf and -Inf with NA
values(RGB_HARV)[is.infinite(values(RGB_HARV))] <- NA

# Get min and max values for all bands
min_max_values <- minmax(RGB_HARV)

# Print the results
cat("Min and Max Values for All Bands:\n")
print(min_max_values)
```

This raster contains values between 0 and 255. These values represent the intensity of brightness associated with the image band. In 
the case of a RGB image (red, green and blue), band 1 is the red band. When we plot the red band, larger numbers (towards 255) represent 
pixels with more red in them (a strong red reflection). Smaller numbers (towards 0) represent pixels with less red in them (less red was reflected). 
To plot an RGB image, we mix red + green + blue values into one single color to create a full color image - this is the standard color image a digital camera creates.

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">

### Challenge: Making Sense of Single Bands of a Multi-Band Image
Go back to the code chunk where you plotted each band separately. Compare the plots of band 1 (red) and band 2 (green). Is the forested area darker or lighter in band 2 (the green band) compared to band 1 (the red band)?  

</div>

```{r challenge1-answer, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE }

# We'd expect a *brighter* value for the forest in band 2 (green) than in # band 1 (red) because the leaves on trees of most often appear "green" - 
# healthy leaves reflect MORE green light compared to red light.

```

## Other Types of Multi-band Raster Data

Multi-band raster data might also contain:

1. **Time series:** the same variable, over the same area, over time. 
2. **Multi or hyperspectral imagery:** image rasters that have 4 or more (multi-spectral) or more than 10-15 (hyperspectral) bands. Check out the NEON
Data Skills <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/hsi-hdf5-r" target="_blank"> **Imaging Spectroscopy HDF5 in R** </a> tutorial to learn how to work with hyperspectral data cubes.

The true color image plotted at the beginning of this lesson looks pretty decent. We can explore whether applying a stretch to the image might improve clarity and contrast using  `stretch="lin"` or `stretch="hist"`.  

<figure>
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/raster-general/imageStretch_dark.jpg">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/raster-general/imageStretch_dark.jpg"
    alt="Graphic depicting stretching pixel brightness values to make a dark satellite image brighter">
    </a>
    <figcaption>When the range of pixel brightness values is closer to 0, a
    darker image is rendered by default. We can stretch the values to extend to
    the full 0-255 range of potential values to increase the visual contrast of
    the image.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/raster-general/imageStretch_light.jpg">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/raster-general/imageStretch_light.jpg"
    alt="Graphic depicting stretching pixel brightness values to make a bright satellite image darker">
    </a>
    <figcaption>When the range of pixel brightness values is closer to 255, a lighter image is rendered by default. We can stretch the values to extend     to the full 0-255 range of potential values to increase the visual contrast of the image.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

```{r image-stretch, fig.cap=c("Composite RGB image of HARV with a linear stretch", "Composite RGB image of HARV with a histogram stretch")}
# What does stretch do?

# Plot the linearly stretched raster
plotRGB(RGB_HARV, stretch="lin")

# Plot the histogram-stretched raster
plotRGB(RGB_HARV, stretch="hist")

```

In this case, the stretch doesn't enhance the contrast our image significantly given the distribution of reflectance (or brightness) values is distributed well between 0 and 255, and applying a stretch appears to introduce some artificial, almost purple-looking brightness to the image.

### Challenge: What Methods Can Be Used on an R Object?
We can view various methods available to call on an R object with `methods(class=class(objectNameHere))`. Use this to figure out:

1. What methods can be used to call on the `RGB_HARV` object? 
2. What methods are available for a single band within `RGB_HARV`? 
3. Why do you think there is a difference? 

</div>

``` {r challenge-code-calling-methods, include=TRUE, results="hide", echo=FALSE}
# 1
# methods for calling a stack
methods(class=class(RGB_HARV))
# 304 methods!

# 2
# methods for calling a band (1)
methods(class=class(RGB_HARV[1]))

# 72 There are more methods you can apply to a full stack (304) than you can apply to a single band (72).
```
