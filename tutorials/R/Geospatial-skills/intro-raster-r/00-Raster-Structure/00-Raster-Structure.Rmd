In this tutorial, we will review the fundamental principles, packages and 
metadata/raster attributes that are needed to work with raster data in R. 
We discuss the three core metadata elements that we need to understand to work 
with rasters in R: **CRS**, **extent** and **resolution**. We also explore
missing and bad data values as stored in a raster and how R handles these
elements. Finally, we introduce the GeoTiff file format.

## About Raster Data
Raster or "gridded" data are stored as a grid of values which are rendered on a 
map as pixels. Each pixel value represents an area on the Earth's surface.

## Raster Data in R

Let's first import a raster dataset into R and explore its metadata. To open rasters in R, we will use the `terra` package.

```{r load-libraries, results="hide"}
library(terra)

# set working directory, you can change this if desired
wd <- "~/data/" 
setwd(wd)
```

## Download LiDAR Raster Data

We can use the neonUtilities function byTileAOP to download a single elevation tiles (DSM and DTM). You can run help(byTileAOP) to see more details on what the various inputs are. For this exercise, we'll specify the UTM Easting and Northing to be (732000, 4713500), which will download the tile with the lower left corner (732000,4713000). By default, the function will check the size total size of the download and ask you whether you wish to proceed (y/n). This file is ~8 MB, so make sure you have enough space on your local drive. You can set `check.size=TRUE` if you want to check the file size before downloading.

``` {r download-dsm-data, eval=FALSE}
byTileAOP(dpID='DP3.30024.001', # lidar elevation
          site='HARV',
          year='2022',
          easting=732000,
          northing=4713500,
          check.size=FALSE, # set to TRUE or remove if you want to check the size before downloading
          savepath = wd)
```
This file will be downloaded into a nested subdirectory under the ~/data folder, inside a folder named DP3.30024.001 (the Data Product ID). The file should show up in this location: ~/data/DP3.30024.001/neon-aop-products/2022/FullSite/D01/2022_HARV_7/L3/DiscreteLidar/DSMGtif/NEON_D01_HARV_DP3_732000_4713000_DSM.tif.

## Open a Raster in R
We can use the `terra("path-to-raster-here")` function to open a raster in R. 

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**  OBJECT NAMES! To improve code 
readability, file and object names should be used that make it clear what is in 
the file. The data for this tutorial were collected over from Harvard Forest so 
we'll use a naming convention of `datatype_HARV`.

</div>

```{r open-raster, fig.cap="Digital surface model showing the elevation of NEON's site Harvard Forest"}
# Load raster into R

dsm_harv_file <- paste0(wd, "DP3.30024.001/neon-aop-products/2022/FullSite/D01/2022_HARV_7/L3/DiscreteLidar/DSMGtif/NEON_D01_HARV_DP3_732000_4713000_DSM.tif")
DSM_HARV <- rast(dsm_harv_file)

# View raster structure
DSM_HARV 

# plot raster
# note \n in the title forces a line break in the title
plot(DSM_HARV, 
     main="Digital Surface Model - HARV")

```


## Types of Data Stored in Raster Format
Raster data can be continuous or categorical. Continuous rasters can have a 
range of quantitative values. Some examples of continuous rasters include:

1. Precipitation maps.
2. Maps of tree height derived from LiDAR data.
3. Elevation values for a region. 

The raster we loaded and plotted earlier was a digital surface model, or a map of the elevation for Harvard Forest derived from the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/airborne-remote-sensing" target="_blank"> 
NEON AOP LiDAR sensor</a>. Elevation is represented as a continuous numeric variable in this map. 
The legend shows the continuous range of values in the data from around 300 to 420 meters.

Some rasters contain categorical data where each pixel represents a discrete
class such as a landcover type (e.g., "forest" or "grassland") rather than a
continuous value such as elevation or temperature. Some examples of classified
maps include:

1. Landcover/land-use maps.
2. Tree height maps classified as short, medium, tall trees.
3. Elevation maps classified as low, medium and high elevation.

# add a color map with 5 colors

# add breaks to the colormap (4 breaks = 3 segments)
brk <- c(250,350, 380,500)

# Expand right side of clipping rect to make room for the legend
par(xpd = FALSE,mar=c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 4.5))
# DEM with a custom legend
plot(DSM_HARV, 
	col=col, 
	breaks=brk, 
	main="Classified Elevation Map - HARV",
	legend = FALSE
	)

# turn xpd back on to force the legend to fit next to the plot.
par(xpd = TRUE)
# add a legend - but make it appear outside of the plot
legend( 733100, 4713700,
        legend = c("High Elevation", "Middle","Low Elevation"), 
        fill = rev(col))
```

## What is a GeoTIFF??
Raster data can come in many different formats. In this tutorial, we will use the 
geotiff format which has the extension `.tif`. A `.tif` file stores metadata
or attributes about the file as embedded `tif tags`. For instance, your camera
might store a tag that describes the make and model of the camera or the date the
photo was taken when it saves a `.tif`. A GeoTIFF is a standard `.tif` image
format with additional spatial (georeferencing) information embedded in the file
as tags. These tags can include the following raster metadata:

1. A Coordinate Reference System (`CRS`)
2. Spatial Extent (`extent`)
3. Values that represent missing data (`NoDataValue`)
4. The `resolution` of the data

In this tutorial we will discuss all of these metadata tags.

More about the  `.tif` format:

* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF" target="_blank"> GeoTIFF on Wikipedia</a>
* <a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/" target="_blank"> OSGEO TIFF documentation</a>

## Coordinate Reference System
The Coordinate Reference System or `CRS` tells R where the raster is located
in geographic space. It also tells R what method should be used to "flatten"
or project the raster in geographic space.

### What Makes Spatial Data Line Up On A Map?
There are many great resources that describe coordinate reference systems and
projections in greater detail (read more, below). For the purposes of this 
activity, it is important to understand that **data from the same location 
but saved in different projections will not line up in any GIS or other 
program**. Thus, it's important when working with spatial data in a program like 
R to identify the coordinate reference system applied to the data and retain 
it throughout data processing and analysis.

### How Map Projections Can Fool the Eye
Check out this short video, from 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBUVGPsJzc1U8SECMgBaMFw" target="_blank"> Buzzfeed</a>, 
highlighting how map projections can make continents seems proportionally larger or smaller than they actually are!

### View Raster Coordinate Reference System (CRS) in R
We can view the `CRS` string associated with our R object using the`crs()` 
method. We can assign this string to an R object, too.

```{r view-crs}
# view crs description
crs(DSM_HARV,describe=TRUE)

# assign crs to an object (class) to use for reprojection and other tasks
harvCRS <- crs(DSM_HARV)

```

The `CRS` of our `DSM_HARV` object tells us that our data are in the UTM projection, in zone 18N.

<figure>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Utm-zones-USA.svg">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Utm-zones-USA.svg/720px-Utm-zones-USA.svg.png"
    alt="Image showing the ten different UTM zones (10-19) across the continental United States."></a>
   	<figcaption> The UTM zones across the continental United States. Source: Chrismurf, wikimedia.org.
		</figcaption>
</figure>

The CRS in this case is in a `char` format. This means that the projection
information is strung together as a series of text elements.

 `+proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0`

We'll focus on the first few components of the CRS in this tutorial.

* `name`: The projection of the dataset. Our data are in WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984) / UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) zone 18N. WGS84 is the datum. The UTM projection divides up the world into zones, this element tells you which zone the data are in. Harvard Forest is in Zone 18.
* `authority`: EPSG (European Petroleum Survey Group) - organization that maintains a geodetic parameter database with standard codes
* `code`: The EPSG code. For more details, see <a href="https://epsg.io/32618" target="_blank">EPSG 32618</a>.

## Extent
The spatial extent is the geographic area that the raster data covers. 

<figure>
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/vector-general/spatial_extent.png">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/vector-general/spatial_extent.png"
    alt="Image of three different spatial extent types: Points extent, lines extent, and polygons extent. Points extent shows three points along the edge of a square object. Lines extent shows a line drawn with three points along the edge of a square object. Polygons extent shows a polygon drawn with three points inside of a square object.">
    </a>
    <figcaption> Image Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)
    </figcaption>
</figure>

The spatial extent of an R spatial object represents the geographic "edge" or 
location that is the furthest north, south, east and west. In other words, `extent` 
represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object. 

You can see the spatial extent using `terra::ext`:

``` {r show-ext}
ext(DSM_HARV)
```

## Resolution
A raster has horizontal (x and y) resolution. This resolution represents the 
area on the ground that each pixel covers. The units for our data are in meters.
Given our data resolution is 1 x 1, this means that each pixel represents a 
1 x 1 meter area on the ground.

<figure>
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/raster-general/raster_resolution.png">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/raster-general/raster_resolution.png"
    alt="Four images of a raster over the same extent, but at four different resolutions from 8 meters to 1 meter. At 8 meters, the image is really blurry. At 1m, the image is really clear. At 4 and 2 meters, the image is somewhere in the middle.">
    </a>
    <figcaption> Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)
    </figcaption>
</figure>

The best way to view resolution units is to look at the coordinate reference system string `crs(rast,proj=TRUE)`. Notice our data contains: `+units=m`.

``` {r resolution-units}
crs(DSM_HARV,proj=TRUE)
```

## Display Raster Min and Max Values

It can be useful to know the minimum or maximum values of a raster dataset. In
this case, given we are working with elevation data, these values represent the 
min/max elevation range at our site.

Raster statistics are often calculated and embedded in a `Geotiff` for us. 
However if they weren't already calculated, we can calculate them using the
`min()` or `max()` functions.

```{r view-min-max }
# view the min and max values
min(DSM_HARV)
```

We can see that the elevation at our site ranges from 317.91 m to 433.94 m.

## NoData Values in Rasters

Raster data often has a `NoDataValue` associated with it. This is a value 
assigned to pixels where data are missing or no data were collected. 

By default the shape of a raster is always square or rectangular. So if we 
have  a dataset that has a shape that isn't square or rectangular, some pixels
at the edge of the raster will have `NoDataValue`s. This often happens when the 
data were collected by an airplane which only flew over some part of a defined 
region. 

Let's take a look at some of the RGB Camera data over HARV, this time downloading a tile at the edge of the flight box.

``` {r download-rgb-data, eval=FALSE}
byTileAOP(dpID='DP3.30010.001',
          site='HARV',
          year='2022',
          easting=737500,
          northing=4701500,
          check.size=FALSE, # set to TRUE or remove if you want to check the size before downloading
          savepath = wd)
```

This file will be downloaded into a nested subdirectory under the ~/data folder, inside a folder named DP3.30010.001 (the Camera Data Product ID). The file should show up in this location: ~/data/DP3.30010.001/neon-aop-products/2022/FullSite/D01/2022_HARV_7/L3/Camera/Mosaic/2022_HARV_7_737000_4701000_image.tif.

In the image below, the pixels that are black have `NoDataValue`s. The camera did not collect data in these areas. 

```{r demonstrate-no-data-black, fig.cap="Colorized raster image with NoDataValues around the edge rendered in black"}
# Use rast function to read in all bands
RGB_HARV <- 
  rast(paste0(wd,"DP3.30010.001/neon-aop-products/2022/FullSite/D01/2022_HARV_7/L3/Camera/Mosaic/2022_HARV_7_737000_4701000_image.tif"))

# Create an RGB image from the raster
par(col.axis="white",col.lab="white",tck=0)
plotRGB(RGB_HARV, r = 1, g = 2, b = 3, axes=TRUE)

```

In the next image, the black edges have been assigned `NoDataValue`. R doesn't 
render pixels that contain a specified `NoDataValue`. R assigns missing data 
with the `NoDataValue` as `NA`.

```{r demonstrate-no-data, fig.cap="Colorized raster image with NoDataValues around the edge removed"}
# reassign cells with 0,0,0 to NA
func <- function(x) {
  x[rowSums(x == 0) == 3, ] <- NA
  x}

newRGBImage <- app(RGB_HARV, func)

par(col.axis="white",col.lab="white",tck=0)
# Create an RGB image from the raster stack
plotRGB(newRGBImage, r = 1, g = 2, b = 3, axis=TRUE)
 
```

### NoData Value Standard 

The assigned `NoDataValue` varies across disciplines; `-9999` is a common value 
used in both the remote sensing field and the atmospheric fields. It is also
the standard used by the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/" target="_blank"> 
National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)</a>. 

If we are lucky, our GeoTIFF file has a tag that tells us what is the
`NoDataValue`. If we are less lucky, we can find that information in the
raster's metadata. If a `NoDataValue` was stored in the GeoTIFF tag, when R
opens up the raster, it will assign each instance of the value to `NA`. Values
of `NA` will be ignored by R as demonstrated above.

## Bad Data Values in Rasters

Bad data values are different from `NoDataValue`s. Bad data values are values 
that fall outside of the applicable range of a dataset. 

Examples of Bad Data Values:

* The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is a measure of 
greenness, has a valid range of -1 to 1. Any value outside of that range would 
be considered a "bad" value.
* Reflectance data in an image should range from 0-1 (or 0-10,000 depending 
upon how the data are scaled). Thus a value greater than 1 or greater than 10,000
is likely caused by an error in either data collection or processing. These 
erroneous values can occur, for example, in water vapor absorption bands, which 
contain invalid data, and are meant to be disregarded.

### Find Bad Data Values
Sometimes a raster's metadata will tell us the range of expected values for a
raster. Values outside of this range are suspect and we need to consider than
when we analyze the data. Sometimes, we need to use some common sense and
scientific insight as we examine the data - just as we would for field data to
identify questionable values. 

## Create A Histogram of Raster Values

We can explore the distribution of values contained within our raster using the 
`hist()` function which produces a histogram. Histograms are often useful in 
identifying outliers and bad data values in our raster data.

```{r view-raster-histogram, fig.cap="Histogram showing the distribution of digital surface model values"}

# view histogram of data
hist(DSM_HARV,
     main="Distribution of Digital Surface Model Values\n NEON Harvard Forest (HARV)",
     xlab="DSM Elevation Value (m)",
     ylab="Frequency",
     col="lightblue")

```

The distribution of elevation values for our `Digital Surface Model (DSM)` looks 
reasonable. It is likely there are no bad data values in this particular raster.

## Raster Bands
The Digital Surface Model object (`DSM_HARV`) that we've been working with 
is a single band raster. This means that there is only one dataset stored in 
the raster: surface elevation in meters for one time period.

<figure>
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/raster-general/single_multi_raster.png">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/raster-general/single_multi_raster.png"
    alt="Left: 3D image of a raster with only one band. Right: 3D image showing four separate layers of a multi band raster."></a>
    <figcaption>Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).
    </figcaption>
</figure>

A raster dataset can contain one or more bands. We can use the `rast`()` function 
to import all bands from a single OR multi-band raster. We can view the number 
of bands in a raster using the `nlyr()` function. 

```{r view-dsm-bands }

# view number of bands in the Lidar DSM raster
nlyr(DSM_HARV)

```
```{r view-rgb-bands }

# view number of bands in the RGB Camera raster
nlyr(RGB_HARV)

```

As we see from the RGB camera raster, raster data can also be multi-band, 
meaning one raster file contains data for more than one variable or time period 
for each cell. By default the `terra::rast()` function imports all bands of a 
multi-band raster. You can set `lyrs = 1` if you only want to read in the first 
layer, for example.

<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/dc-multiband-rasters-r" target="_blank">
*Work with Multi-band Rasters: Images in R*</a>.

## View Raster File Attributes

Remember that a `GeoTIFF` contains a set of embedded tags that contain 
metadata about the raster. So far, we've explored raster metadata **after**
importing it in R. However, we can use the `describe("path-to-raster-here")`
function to view raster information (such as metadata) before we open a file in 
R. Use `help(describe)` to see other options for exploring the file contents.

```{r describe-meta}

# view metadata attributes before opening the file
describe(path.expand(dsm_harv_file),meta=TRUE)

```
Specifying `options=c("stats")` will show some summary statistics:

```{r describe-stats}

# view summary statistics before opening the file
describe(path.expand(dsm_harv_file),options=c("stats"))

```


It can be useful to use `describe` to explore your file **before** reading it into R.

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">

### Challenge: Explore Raster Metadata 

Without using the `terra` function to read the file into R, determine the following information about the DTM file. This was downloaded at the same time as the DSM file, and as long as you didn't move the data, it should be located here: ~/data/DP3.30024.001/neon-aop-products/2022/FullSite/D01/2022_HARV_7/L3/DiscreteLidar/DTMGtif/NEON_D01_HARV_DP3_732000_4713000_DTM.tif. 

1. Does this file has the same `CRS` as `DSM_HARV`?
2. What is the `NoDataValue`?
3. What is resolution of the raster data? 
4. Is the file a multi- or single-band raster?
5. On what dates was this site flown?
