Sometimes we encounter raster datasets that do not "line up" when plotted or 
analyzed. Rasters that don't line up are most often in different Coordinate
Reference Systems (CRS).

This tutorial explains how to deal with rasters in different, known Coordinate 
Reference Systems (CRS). It demonstrates how to re-project rasters in R using 
the `project() function in the `terra` package.

## Raster Projection in R

In the
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/dc-plot-raster-data-r" target="_blank"> *Plot Raster Data in R* tutorial</a>,
we learned how to layer a raster file on top of a hillshade for a nice
looking basemap. In this tutorial, all of our data were in the same CRS. What 
happens when things don't line up?

We will use the `raster` and `rgdal` packages in this tutorial.  

```{r load-libraries }
# load raster package
library(terra)
# set working directory
wd <- "~/data/"
setwd(wd)
```

Let's create a map of the Harvard Forest Digital Terrain Model 
(`DTM_HARV`) draped or layered on top of the hillshade (`DTM_hill_HARV`).

```{r import-DTM-hillshade, fig.cap="Digital terrain model overlaying the hillshade raster showing the 3D ground surface of NEON's site Harvard Forest"}
# import DTM
DTM_HARV <- raster(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop.tif"))
# import DTM hillshade
DTM_hill_HARV <- 
  raster(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_DTMhill_WGS84.tif"))

# plot hillshade using a grayscale color ramp 
plot(DTM_hill_HARV,
    col=grey(1:100/100),
    legend=FALSE,
    main="DTM Hillshade\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")

# overlay the DTM on top of the hillshade
plot(DTM_HARV,
     col=terrain.colors(10),
     alpha=0.4,
     add=TRUE,
     legend=FALSE)

```

Our results are curious - the Digital Terrain Model (`DTM_HARV`) did not plot on
top of our hillshade. The hillshade plotted just fine on it's own. Let's try to 
plot the DTM on it's own to make sure there are data there.

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">

<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**Code Tip:** For boolean R elements, such as
 `add=TRUE`, you can use `T` and `F` in place of `TRUE` and `FALSE`.
 
</div>

```{r plot-DTM, fig.cap="Digital terrain model showing the ground surface of NEON's site Harvard Forest"}
# Plot DTM 
plot(DTM_HARV,
     col=terrain.colors(10),
     alpha=1,
     legend=F,
     main="Digital Terrain Model - HARV")

```

Our DTM seems to contain data and plots just fine. Let's next check the
 Coordinate Reference System (CRS) and compare it to our hillshade.

```{r explore-crs }
# view crs for DTM
crs(DTM_HARV)

# view crs for hillshade
crs(DTM_hill_HARV)
```

Aha! `DTM_HARV` is in the UTM projection. `DTM_hill_HARV` is in
`Geographic WGS84` - which is represented by latitude and longitude values.
Because the two rasters are in different CRSs, they don't line up when plotted
in R. We need to *re-project* `DTM_hill_HARV` into the UTM CRS. Alternatively,
we could project `DTM_HARV` into WGS84. 

## Reproject Rasters
We can use the `projectRaster` function to re-project a raster into a new CRS.
Keep in mind that re-projection only works when you first have a *defined* CRS
for the raster object that you want to re-project. It cannot be used if *no*
CRS is defined. Lucky for us, the `DTM_hill_HARV` has a defined CRS. 

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** When we re-project a raster, we 
move it from one "grid" to another. Thus, we are modifying the data! Keep this 
in mind as we work with raster data. 

</div>

To use the `project` function, we need to define two things:

1. the object we want to re-project and 
2. the CRS that we want to re-project it to

To see the inputs/outputs type `help("project")`.

We want the CRS of our hillshade to match the `DTM_HARV` raster. We can thus
assign the CRS of our `DTM_HARV` to our hillshade within the `project()`
function as follows: `crs=crs(DTM_HARV)`.

```{r reproject-raster }

# reproject to UTM
DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV <- projectRaster(DTM_hill_HARV, 
                                       crs=crs(DTM_HARV))

# compare attributes of DTM_hill_UTMZ18N to DTM_hill
crs(DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV)
crs(DTM_hill_HARV)

# compare attributes of DTM_hill_UTMZ18N to DTM_hill
extent(DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV)
extent(DTM_hill_HARV)

```

Notice in the output above that the `crs()` of `DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV` is now
UTM. However, the extent values of `DTM_hillUTMZ18N_HARV` are different from
`DTM_hill_HARV`.

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
### Challenge: Extent Change with CRS Change
Why do you think the two extents differ?  
</div>

```{r challenge-code-extent-crs, echo=FALSE}
# The extent for DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV is in UTMs so the extent is in meters. 
# The extent for DTM_hill_HARV is still in lat/long so the extent is expressed
# in decimal degrees.  
```


## Deal with Raster Resolution

Let's next have a look at the resolution of our re-projected hillshade.  

```{r view-resolution}

# compare resolution
res(DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV)

```

The output resolution of `DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV` is 1 x 0.998. Yet, we know that
the resolution for the data should be 1m x 1m. We can tell R to force our
newly reprojected raster to be 1m x 1m resolution by adding a line of code
(`res=`).  

``` {r reproject-assign-resolution, fig.cap="Reprojected digital terrain model overlaying the hillshade raster showing the 3D ground surface of NEON's site Harvard Forest"}
# adjust the resolution 
DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV <- projectRaster(DTM_hill_HARV, 
                                  crs=crs(DTM_HARV),
                                  res=1)
# view resolution
res(DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV)

```

Let's plot our newly reprojected raster.

```{r plot-projected-raster }
# plot newly reprojected hillshade
plot(DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV,
    col=grey(1:100/100),
    legend=F,
    main="DTM with Hillshade\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")

# overlay the DTM on top of the hillshade
plot(DTM_HARV,
     col=terrain.colors(100),
     alpha=0.4,
     add=T,
     legend=F)
```

We have now successfully draped the Digital Terrain Model on top of our
hillshade to produce a nice looking, textured map!
