## About Vector Data
Vector data are composed of discrete geometric locations (x,y values) known as
**vertices** that define the "shape" of the spatial object. The organization 
of the vertices, determines the type of vector that we are working 
with: point, line or polygon.

<figure>

    <figcaption> There are 3 types of vector objects: points, lines or 
    polygons. Each object type has a different structure.

    </figcaption>
</figure>

* **Points:** Each individual point is defined by a single x, y coordinate.
There can be many points in a vector point file. Examples of point data include:
sampling locations, the location of individual trees or the location of plots.
* **Lines:** Lines are composed of many (at least 2) vertices, or points, that
are connected. For instance, a road or a stream may be represented by a line. This
line is composed of a series of segments, each "bend" in the road or stream 
represents a vertex that has defined `x, y` location.
* **Polygons:** A polygon consists of 3 or more vertices that are connected and 
"closed". Thus the outlines of plot boundaries, lakes, oceans, and states or 
countries are often represented by polygons. Occasionally, a polygon can have a
hole in the middle of it (like a doughnut), this is something to be aware of but
not an issue we will deal with in this tutorial.

 <div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Sometimes, boundary layers such as 
 states and countries, are stored as lines rather than polygons. However, these
 boundaries, when represented as a line, will not create a closed object with a defined "area" that can be "filled".
</div>

## Shapefiles: Points, Lines, and Polygons
Geospatial data in vector format are often stored in a `shapefile` format. 
Because the structure of points, lines, and polygons are different, each
individual shapefile can only contain one vector type (all points, all lines
or all polygons). You will not find a mixture of point, line and polygon
objects in a single shapefile.

Objects stored in a shapefile often have a set of associated `attributes` that
describe the data. For example, a line shapefile that contains the locations of 
streams, might contain the associated stream name, stream "order" and other
information about each stream line object.

* More about shapefiles can found on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.

## Import Shapefiles

We will use the `rgdal` package to work with vector data in R. Notice that the
`sp` package automatically loads when `rgdal` is loaded. We will also load the
`raster` package so we can explore raster and vector spatial metadata using similar commands.

```{r load-libraries }

# load required libraries
# for vector work; sp package will load with rgdal.
library(rgdal)  
# for metadata/attributes- vectors or rasters
library(raster) 

# set working directory to the directory location on your computer where
# you downloaded and unzipped the data files for the tutorial
# setwd("pathToDirHere")
```

The shapefiles that we will import are:

* A polygon shapefile representing our field site boundary, 
* A line shapefile representing roads, and 
* A point shapefile representing the location of the Fisher   
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/flux-tower-measurements" target="_blank">flux tower</a> 
located at the
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV" target="_blank"> NEON Harvard Forest field site</a>.

The first shapefile that we will open contains the boundary of our study area
(or our Area Of Interest or AOI, hence the name `aoiBoundary`). To import 
shapefiles we use the R function `readOGR()`.

`readOGR()` requires two components:

1. The directory where our shapefile lives: `NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV`
2. The name of the shapefile (without the extension): `HarClip_UTMZ18`

Let's import our AOI.

```{r Import-Shapefile}

# Import a polygon shapefile: readOGR("path","fileName")
# no extension needed as readOGR only imports shapefiles
aoiBoundary_HARV <- readOGR(dsn=path.expand("NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV"),
                            layer="HarClip_UTMZ18")


```

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** The acronym, OGR, refers to the
OpenGIS Simple Features Reference Implementation.

</div>  

## Shapefile Metadata & Attributes

When we import the `HarClip_UTMZ18` shapefile layer into R (as our
`aoiBoundary_HARV` object), the `readOGR()` function automatically stores
information about the data. We are particularly interested in the geospatial
**metadata**, describing the format, `CRS`, `extent`, and other components of
the vector data, and the **attributes** which describe properties associated
with each individual vector object. 

 <div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** The 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/dc-shapefile-attributes-r" target="_blank">*Shapefile Metadata & Attributes in R*</a> 
tutorial provides more information on both metadata and attributes
and using attributes to subset and plot data. 
</div>

## Spatial Metadata
Key metadata for all shapefiles include:

1. **Object Type:** the class of the imported object. 
2. **Coordinate Reference System (CRS):** the projection of the data.
3. **Extent:** the spatial extent (geographic area that the shapefile covers) of 
the shapefile. Note that the spatial extent for a shapefile represents the 
extent for ALL spatial objects in the shapefile.

We can view shapefile metadata using the `class`, `crs` and `extent` methods:

```{r view-metadata }
# view just the class for the shapefile
class(aoiBoundary_HARV)

# view just the crs for the shapefile
crs(aoiBoundary_HARV)

# view just the extent for the shapefile
extent(aoiBoundary_HARV)

# view all metadata at same time
aoiBoundary_HARV
```

Our `aoiBoundary_HARV` object is a polygon of class `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`, 
in the CRS **UTM zone 18N**. The CRS is critical to interpreting the object 
`extent` values as it specifies units.

    <figcaption>The spatial extent of a shapefile or R spatial object represents
    the geographic "edge" or location that is the furthest north, south east and 
    west. Thus is represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object.

</figure>

## Spatial Data Attributes
Each object in a shapefile has one or more attributes associated with it.
Shapefile attributes are similar to fields or columns in a spreadsheet. Each row
in the spreadsheet has a set of columns associated with it that describe the row
element. In the case of a shapefile, each row represents a spatial object - for
example, a road, represented as a line in a line shapefile, will have one "row" 
of attributes associated with it. These attributes can include different types 
of information that describe objects stored within a shapefile. Thus, our road,
may have a name, length, number of lanes, speed limit, type of road and other
attributes stored with it.

    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/dc-spatial-vector/Attribute_Table.png">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/dc-spatial-vector/Attribute_Table.png" alt="Example attribute tables for each different type of vector object."></a>
    <figcaption>Each spatial feature in an R spatial object has the same set of 
    associated attributes that describe or characterize the feature.
    Attribute data are stored in a separate *.dbf file. Attribute data can be
    compared to a spreadsheet. Each row in a spreadsheet represents one feature
    in the spatial object.
    Image Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) 
    </figcaption>
</figure>


We view the attributes of a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` using `objectName@data`
(e.g., `aoiBoundary_HARV@data`). 

``` {r Shapefile-attributes-2}
# alternate way to view attributes 
aoiBoundary_HARV@data

```

In this case, our polygon object only has one attribute: `id`.

## Metadata & Attribute Summary
We can view a metadata & attribute summary of each shapefile by entering 
the name of the R object in the console. Note that the metadata output
includes the **class**, the number of **features**, the **extent**, and the
**coordinate reference system** (`crs`) of the R object. The last two lines of
`summary` show a preview of the R object **attributes**.

```{r shapefile-summary}
# view a summary of metadata & attributes associated with the spatial object
summary(aoiBoundary_HARV)

```


# Plot a Shapefile
Next, let's visualize the data in our R `spatialpolygonsdataframe` object using
`plot()`.

``` {r plot-shapefile, fig.cap="Area of Interest Boundary (NEON Harvard Forest Field Site)"}
# create a plot of the shapefile
# 'lwd' sets the line width
# 'col' sets internal color
# 'border' sets line color
plot(aoiBoundary_HARV, col="cyan1", border="black", lwd=3,
     main="AOI Boundary Plot")

```

### Challenge: Import Line and Point Shapefiles
Using the steps above, import the HARV_roads and HARVtower_UTM18N layers into
R. Call the Harv_roads object `lines_HARV` and the HARVtower_UTM18N
`point_HARV`.

Answer the following questions:

1. What type of R spatial object is created when you import each layer?
2. What is the `CRS` and `extent`for each object?
3. Do the files contain, points, lines or polygons?
4. How many spatial objects are in each file?
</div>

```{r import-point-line, echo=FALSE, results="hide" }
# import line shapefile
lines_HARV <- readOGR("NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV",layer = "HARV_roads")
# import point shapefile
point_HARV <- readOGR("NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV", layer="HARVtower_UTM18N")

# 1
class(lines_HARV)
class(point_HARV)

# 2
crs(lines_HARV)
extent(lines_HARV)
crs(point_HARV)
extent(point_HARV)

# 3 
#lines_HARV contains only lines and point_HARV contains only 1 point

# 4 -> numerous ways to find this; lines_HARV=13,
length(lines_HARV)  #easiest, but not previously taught
lines_HARV  #look at 'features'
attributes(lines_HARV)  #found in the $data section as above

# Alternative code for 1-4: view metadata/attributes all at once
lines_HARV
attributes(lines_HARV)

```

## Plot Multiple Shapefiles
The `plot()` function can be used for basic plotting of spatial objects. 
We use the `add = TRUE` argument to overlay shapefiles on top of each other, as
we would when creating a map in a typical GIS application like QGIS.

We can use `main=""` to give our plot a title. If we want the title to span two
lines, we use `\n` where the line should break.

```{r plot-multiple-shapefiles, fig.cap="NEON Harvard Forest Field Site showing tower location and surrounding roads."}
# Plot multiple shapefiles
plot(aoiBoundary_HARV, col = "lightgreen", 
     main="NEON Harvard Forest\nField Site")
plot(lines_HARV, add = TRUE)

# use the pch element to adjust the symbology of the points
plot(point_HARV, add  = TRUE, pch = 19, col = "purple")
```


<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
### Challenge: Plot Raster & Vector Data Together


You can plot vector data layered on top of raster data using the `add=TRUE`
plot attribute. Create a plot that uses the NEON AOP Canopy Height Model `NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/CHM/HARV_chmCrop.tif` as a base layer. On top of the
CHM, please add:

* The study site AOI.
* Roads.
* The tower location.

Be sure to give your plot a meaningful title.

```{r challenge-vector-raster-overlay, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="NEON Harvard Forest Field Site showing tower location and surrounding roads with a Canopy Height Model overlay." }

# import CHM
chm_HARV <- raster("NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/CHM/HARV_chmCrop.tif")

plot(chm_HARV,
     main="Map of Study Area\n w/ Canopy Height Model\nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site")

plot(lines_HARV, 
     add = TRUE,
     col="black")
plot(aoiBoundary_HARV, border="grey20", 
     add = TRUE,
     lwd=4)
plot(point_HARV, pch=8, 
     add=TRUE)

```
