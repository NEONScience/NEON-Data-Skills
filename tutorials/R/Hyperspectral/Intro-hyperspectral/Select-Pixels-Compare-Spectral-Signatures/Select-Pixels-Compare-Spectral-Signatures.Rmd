<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/SJER" target="_blank" > San Joaquin 
Exerimental Range field site</a> in March of 2019.
The data were collected over the San Joaquin field site located in California 
(Domain 17) and processed at NEON headquarters. This data subset is derived from 
the mosaic tile named NEON_D17_SJER_DP3_257000_4112000_reflectance.h5.

**Remember** that the example dataset linked here only has 1 out of every 4 bands
included in a full NEON hyperspectral dataset (this substantially reduces the file 
size!). When we refer to bands in this tutorial, we will note the band numbers for 
this example dataset, which are different from NEON production data. To convert 
a band number (b) from this example data subset to the equivalent band in a full 
NEON hyperspectral file (b'), use the following equation: b' = 1+4*(b-1).

### Recommended Skills

This tutorial will require that you be comfortable navigating HDF5 files, 
and have an understanding of what spectral signatures are. For additional 
information on these topics, we highly recommend you work through the 
<a href="https://neonscience.org/intro-hsi-r-series" target="_blank"> *Introduction to Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data* series</a>
before moving on to this tutorial.

</div>


## Getting Started

First, we need to load our required packages, and import the hyperspectral
data (in HDF5 format). We will also collect a few other important pieces of 
information (band wavelengths and scaling factor) while we're at it.

```{r load-libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Load required packages
library(rhdf5)
library(reshape2)
library(raster)
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where
# we want to save our files. Be sure to move the download into your working directory!
wd <- "~/Documents/data/" #This will depend on your local environment
setwd(wd)

# define filepath to the hyperspectral dataset
f <- paste0(wd,"NEON_hyperspectral_tutorial_example_subset.h5")

# read in the wavelength information from the HDF5 file
wavelengths <- h5read(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Spectral_Data/Wavelength")

# grab scale factor from the Reflectance attributes
reflInfo <- h5readAttributes(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data" )

scaleFact <- reflInfo$Scale_Factor

```

Now, we read in the RGB image that we created in an earlier tutorial and plot it. 
If you didn't make this image before, you can download it from the link at the top 
of this page.

```{r read-in-RGB-and-plot, fig.cap="RGB image of a portion of the SJER field site using 3 bands from the raster stack. Brightness values have been stretched using the stretch argument to produce a natural looking image. At the top right of the image, there is dark, brakish water. Scattered throughout the image, there are several trees. At the center of the image, there is a baseball field, with low grass. At the bottom left of the image, there is a parking lot and some buildings with highly reflective surfaces, and adjacent to it is a section of a gravel lot."}

# Read in RGB image as a 'stack' rather than a plain 'raster'
rgbStack <- stack(paste0(wd,"NEON_hyperspectral_tutorial_example_RGB_stack_image.tif"))

# Plot as RGB image
plotRGB(rgbStack,
        r=1,g=2,b=3, scale=300, 
        stretch = "lin")

```

## Interactive `click` Function from `raster` Package

Next, we use an interactive clicking function to identify the pixels that we want
to extract spectral signatures for. To follow along best with this tutorial, we 
suggest the following five cover types (exact location shown below). 

1. Irrigated grass
2. Tree canopy (avoid the shaded northwestern side of the tree)
3. Roof
4. Bare soil (baseball diamond infield)
5. Open water

As shown here:

    alt="RGB image of a portion of the SJER field site using 3 bands fom the raster stack. Also displayed are points labeled with numbers one through five, representing five cover types selected using the interactive click function from the raster package. At the top right of the image, the dark, brakish water has been selected as point 5. The tops of a cluster of trees on the top left of the image has been selected as point 2. At the center of the image, the baseball field with low grass has been selected as point 1. At the bottom left of the image the top of a building has been selected as point 3, and the adjacent gravel lot has been selected as point 4. Plotting parameters have been changed to enhance visibility.">

</figure>


```{r click-to-select, eval=FALSE, comment=NA}

# change plotting parameters to better see the points and numbers generated from clicking
par(col="red", cex=3)

# use the 'click' function
c <- click(rgbStack, id=T, xy=T, cell=T, type="p", pch=16, col="magenta", col.lab="red")

```

Once you have clicked your five points, press the `ESC` key to save your
clicked points and close the function before moving on to the next step. If 
you make a mistake in the step, run the `plotRGB()` function again to start over.
```{r create-c-hidden, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
c <- as.data.frame(c(135750,50101,234644,242062,73477))
names(c) <- "cell"
```

The `click()` function identifies the cell number that you clicked, but in order 
to extract spectral signatures, we need to convert that cell number into a row
and column, as shown here:

```{r convert-cell-to-row-column}
# convert raster cell number into row and column (used to extract spectral signature below)
c$row <- c$cell%/%nrow(rgbStack)+1 # add 1 because R is 1-indexed
c$col <- c$cell%%ncol(rgbStack)
```

## Extract Spectral Signatures from HDF5 file
Next, we loop through each of the cells that we selected to use the `h5read()` 
function to etract the reflectance values of all bands from the given row and
column. 

```{r extract-spectral-signaures}

# create a new dataframe from the band wavelengths so that we can add
# the reflectance values for each cover type
Pixel_df <- as.data.frame(wavelengths)

# loop through each of the cells that we selected
for(i in 1:length(c$cell)){
# extract Spectra from a single pixel
aPixel <- h5read(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data",
                 index=list(NULL,c$col[i],c$row[i]))

# scale reflectance values from 0-1
aPixel <- aPixel/as.vector(scaleFact)

# reshape the data and turn into dataframe
b <- adply(aPixel,c(1))

# rename the column that we just created
names(b)[2] <- paste0("Point_",i)

# add reflectance values for this pixel to our combined data.frame called Pixel_df
Pixel_df <- cbind(Pixel_df,b[2])
}

```

## Plot Spectral signatures using ggplot2
Finally, we have everything that we need to plot the spectral signatures for 
each of the pixels that we clicked. In order to color our lines by the different
land cover types, we will first reshape our data using the `melt()` function, then
plot the spectral signatures.

```{r plot-spectral-signatures, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Plot of spectral signatures for the five different land cover types: Field, Tree, Roof, Soil, and Water. On the x-axis is wavelength in nanometers and on the y-axis is reflectance values."}
# Use the melt() funciton to reshape the dataframe into a format that ggplot prefers
Pixel.melt <- melt(Pixel_df, id.vars = "wavelengths", value.name = "Reflectance")

# Now, let's plot some spectral signatures!
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data = Pixel.melt, mapping = aes(x=wavelengths, y=Reflectance, color=variable), lwd=1.5)+
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("green2", "green4", "grey50","tan4","blue3"),
                      labels = c("Field", "Tree", "Roof","Soil","Water"))+
  labs(color = "Cover Type")+
  ggtitle("Land cover spectral signatures")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=20))+
  xlab("Wavelength")
```

Nice! However, there seems to be something weird going on in the wavelengths 
near 1400nm and 1850 nm...

## Atmospheric Absorbtion Bands 
Those irregularities around 1400nm and 1850 nm are two major atmospheric 
absorbtion bands - regions where gasses in the atmosphere (primarily carbon 
dioxide and water vapor) absorb radiation, and therefore, obscure the 
reflected radiation that the imaging spectrometer measures. Fortunately, the 
lower and upper bound of each of those atmopheric absopbtion bands is specified 
in the HDF5 file. Let's read those bands and plot rectangles where the 
reflectance measurements are obscured by atmospheric absorbtion. 

```{r mask-atmospheric-absorbtion-bands, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Plot of spectral signatures for the five different land cover types: Field, Tree, Roof, Soil, and Water. Added to the plot are two rectangles in regions near 1400nm and 1850nm where the reflectance measurements are obscured by atmospheric absorption. On the x-axis is wavelength in nanometers and on the y-axis is reflectance values."}

# grab Reflectance metadata (which contains absorption band limits)
reflMetadata <- h5readAttributes(f,"/SJER/Reflectance" )

ab1 <- reflMetadata$Band_Window_1_Nanometers
ab2 <- reflMetadata$Band_Window_2_Nanometers

# Plot spectral signatures again with rectangles showing the absorption bands
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data = Pixel.melt, mapping = aes(x=wavelengths, y=Reflectance, color=variable), lwd=1.5)+
  geom_rect(mapping=aes(ymin=min(Pixel.melt$Reflectance),ymax=max(Pixel.melt$Reflectance), xmin=ab1[1], xmax=ab1[2]), color="black", fill="grey40", alpha=0.8)+
  geom_rect(mapping=aes(ymin=min(Pixel.melt$Reflectance),ymax=max(Pixel.melt$Reflectance), xmin=ab2[1], xmax=ab2[2]), color="black", fill="grey40", alpha=0.8)+
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("green2", "green4", "grey50","tan4","blue3"),
                      labels = c("Field", "Tree", "Roof","Soil","Water"))+
  labs(color = "Cover Type")+
  ggtitle("Land cover spectral signatures")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=20))+
  xlab("Wavelength")
```

Now we can clearly see that the noisy sections of each spectral signature are 
within the atmospheric absorbtion bands. For our final step, let's take all 
reflectance values from within each absorbtion band and set them to `NA` to 
remove the noisy sections from the plot.

```{r remove-absorbtion-band-reflectances, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Plot of spectral signatures for the five different land cover types: Field, Tree, Roof, Soil, and Water. Values falling within the two rectangles from the previous image have been set to NA and ommited from the plot. On the x-axis is wavelength in nanometers and on the y-axis is reflectance values."}

# Duplicate the spectral signatures into a new data.frame
Pixel.melt.masked <- Pixel.melt

# Mask out all values within each of the two atmospheric absorbtion bands
Pixel.melt.masked[Pixel.melt.masked$wavelengths>ab1[1]&Pixel.melt.masked$wavelengths<ab1[2],]$Reflectance <- NA
Pixel.melt.masked[Pixel.melt.masked$wavelengths>ab2[1]&Pixel.melt.masked$wavelengths<ab2[2],]$Reflectance <- NA

# Plot the masked spectral signatures
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data = Pixel.melt.masked, mapping = aes(x=wavelengths, y=Reflectance, color=variable), lwd=1.5)+
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("green2", "green4", "grey50","tan4","blue3"),
                      labels = c("Field", "Tree", "Roof", "Soil", "Water"))+
  labs(color = "Cover Type")+
  ggtitle("Land cover spectral signatures")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=20))+
  xlab("Wavelength")

```

There you have it, spectral signatures for five different land cover types, 
with the readings from the atmospheric absorbtion bands removed.

### Challenge: Compare Spectral Signatures

There are many interesting comparisons to make with spectral signatures. 
Try these challenges to explore hyperspectral data further:

1. Compare five different types of vegetation, and pick an appropriate color
for each of their lines. A nice guide to the many different color options
in R can be found <a href="http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour" target="_blank"> *here*.</a>

2. What happens if you only click four points? What about six? How does this
change the spectral signature plots, and can you fix any errors that occur?

3. Does shallow water have a different spectral signature than deep water?

</div>

```{r challenge-answer, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

# Challenge Answers - These challenge problems will depend on the specific
# pixels that you select, but here we can answer these questions in general.

# 1. Each vegetation class will likely have slightly different spectral signatures, 
# mostly distinguished by the amplitude of the near-IR bands. As we saw in this 
# tutorial, irrigated grass has a much higher reflectance in the near-IR than 
# does the tree canopy. In general, grasses and irrigated vegetation have a higher 
# reflectance than do natural vegetation, and deciduous trees higher than conifers.

# 2. If you click four points, the script should work, but the plot labels and 
# colors might be wrong (for example, if you skip the soil point, your water point 
# may have the soil color and label). If you click six points, you will get an error
# that the ggplot function needs six colors and labels in the scale_color_manual() 
# function. You can simply add the appropriate color and label for your sixth point 
# if you want!

# 3. Yes, shallow water usually has a different spectral signature than deep water. 
# This is because shallow water actually reflects some light from the soil at the 
# bottom of the water column, so the resulting spectral signature will look like 
# a combination of bare soil and water. 

```
