In 2016 the NEON AOP flew the PRIN site in D11 on a poor weather day to ensure coverage of the site. The following day, the weather improved and the site was flown again to collect clear-weather spectrometer data. Having collections only one day apart provides an opportunity to assess LiDAR uncertainty because we expect that nothing has changed at the site between the two collections. In this exercise we will analyze several NEON Level 3 lidar rasters to assess the uncertainty.

In this exercise we will analyze several NEON Level-3 lidar rasters (DSM, DTM, and CHM) 
and assess the uncertainty between data collected over the same area on different days, collected a day apart.

## Create a lidar-derived Canopy Height Model (CHM)

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) will provide lidar-derived 
data products as one of its many free ecological data products. These products 
will come in the 
<a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/" target="_blank">GeoTIFF</a> 
format, which is a .tif raster format that is spatially located on the earth. 

In this tutorial, we create a Canopy Height Model. The 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/chm-dsm-dtm-gridded-lidar-data" target="_blank">Canopy Height Model (CHM)</a>,
represents the heights of the trees on the ground. We can derive the CHM 
by subtracting the ground elevation from the elevation of the top of the surface 
(or the tops of the trees). 

We will use the `terra` R package to work with the the lidar-derived Digital 
Surface Model (DSM) and the Digital Terrain Model (DTM). 


    # Load needed packages

    library(terra)

    library(neonUtilities)

    library(ggplot2)

Set the working directory so you know where to download data.


    wd="~/data/" #This will depend on your local environment

    setwd(wd)

We can use the `neonUtilities` function `byTileAOP` to download a single DTM and DSM tile at PRIN. Both the DTM and DSM are delivered under the <a href="https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP3.30024.001" target="_blank">Elevation - LiDAR (DP3.30024.001)</a> data product.

You can run `help(byTileAOP)` to see more details on what the various inputs are. For this exercise, we'll specify the UTM Easting and Northing to be (607000, 3696000), which will download the tile with the lower left corner (607000, 3696000). By default, the function will check the size total size of the download and ask you whether you wish to proceed (y/n). You can set `check.size=FALSE` if you want to download without a prompt. This example will not be very large (~8MB), since it is only downloading two single-band rasters (plus some associated metadata).


    byTileAOP(dpID='DP3.30015.001',

              site='PRIN',

              year='2016',

              easting=607000,

              northing=3696000,

              check.size=FALSE, # set to TRUE if you want to confirm before downloading

              savepath = wd)

The fileS from the two 2016 collections (2016_PRIN_1 and 2016_PRIN_2) will be downloaded into a nested 
subdirectory under the `~/data` folder, inside a folder named `DP3.30024.001` (the Data Product ID). 
The files should show up in these locations:  `~/data/DP3.30015.001/neon-aop-products/2016/FullSite/D11/2016_PRIN_1/L3/DiscreteLidar/CanopyHeightModelGtif/NEON_D11_PRIN_DP3_607000_3696000_CHM.tif` and `~/data/DP3.30024.001/neon-aop-products/2016/FullSite/D11/2016_PRIN_2/L3/DiscreteLidar/CanopyHeightModelGtif/NEON_D11_PRIN_DP3_607000_3696000_CHM.tif`.

Similarly, we can download the Digital Elevation Models (DSM and DEM) as follows:


    byTileAOP(dpID='DP3.30024.001',

              site='PRIN',

              year='2016',

              easting=607000,

              northing=3696000,

              check.size=FALSE, # set to TRUE if you want to confirm before downloading

              savepath = wd)

These files should be located in the folder:
`~/data/DP3.30024.001/neon-aop-products/2016/FullSite/D11/2016_PRIN_1/L3/DiscreteLidar/DSMGtif/` and 
`~/data/DP3.30024.001/neon-aop-products/2016/FullSite/D11/2016_PRIN_1/L3/DiscreteLidar/DTMGtif/`.

Now we can read in the files. You can move the files to a different location (eg. shorten the path), but make sure to change the path that points to the file accordingly.


    # Define the CHM, DSM and DTM file names, including the full path

    chm_file1 <- paste0(wd,"DP3.30015.001/neon-aop-products/2016/FullSite/D11/2016_PRIN_1/L3/DiscreteLidar/CanopyHeightModelGtif/NEON_D11_PRIN_DP3_607000_3696000_CHM.tif")

    dtm_file1 <- paste0(wd,"DP3.30024.001/neon-aop-products/2016/FullSite/D11/2016_PRIN_1/L3/DiscreteLidar/DTMGtif/NEON_D11_PRIN_DP3_607000_3696000_DTM.tif")

We can use terra::rast` to read in all these files.

Since we want to know what changed between the two days, we will difference the sets of rasters (i.e. DSM1 - DSM2)



    # Difference the 2 DSM rasters

    dsm_diff <- dsm1 - dsm2

    

    # Calculate mean and standard deviation

    dsm_diff_mean <- as.numeric(global(dsm_diff, fun = "mean", na.rm = TRUE))

    dsm_diff_std_dev <- as.numeric(global(dsm_diff, fun = "sd", na.rm = TRUE))

    

    # Print the statistics

    print(paste("Mean DSM Difference:", round(dsm_diff_mean,3)))

    ## [1] "Mean DSM Difference: 0.019"

    print(paste("Standard Deviation of DSM Difference:", round(dsm_diff_std_dev,3)))

    ## [1] "Standard Deviation of DSM Difference: 0.743"

The mean is close to zero (0.019 m), indicating there was very little systematic 
bias between the two days. However, we notice that the standard deviation of the 
data is quite high at 0.743 meters. Generally we expect NEON LiDAR data to have 
an error below 0.15 meters! Let's take a look at a histogram of the DSM difference
raster to see if we can get a better idea of what's going on.



    # Set options to avoid scientific notation

    options(scipen = 999)

    

    # Plot a histogram of the raster values

    hist(dsm_diff, breaks = 100, main = "Histogram of DSM Difference", xlab = "Height Difference (m)", ylab = "Frequency", col = "lightblue", border = "black")

![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/AOP/Lidar/lidar-uncertainty/rfigs/dsm-diff-hist-1.png)

The histogram has long tails, obscuring the distribution near the center. To 
constrain the x-limits of the histogram we will use the mean and standard 
deviation just calculated. Since the data appears to be normally distributed, 
we can constrain the histogram to 95% of the data by including 2 standard 
deviations above and below the mean.



    # Calculate x-axis limits: mean Â± 2 * standard deviation

    xlim_lower <- dsm_diff_mean - 2 * dsm_diff_std_dev

    xlim_upper <- dsm_diff_mean + 2 * dsm_diff_std_dev

    

    # Plot a histogram of the raster values with 100 bins, x-axis set to Â±2 standard deviations

    hist(dsm_diff, breaks = 250, xlim = c(xlim_lower, xlim_upper), 
         main = "Histogram of Difference DSM", xlab = "Height Difference (m)", 
         ylab = "Frequency", col = "lightblue", border = "black")

![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/AOP/Lidar/lidar-uncertainty/rfigs/dsm-diff-hist-zoomed-in-1.png)
The histogram shows a wide variation in DSM differences, with those at the 95% 
limit at around +/- 1.5 m. Let's take a look at the spatial distribution of the 
errors by plotting a map of the difference between the two DSMs. Here we'll also
use the extra variable in the plot function to constrain the limits of the 
colorbar to 95% of the observations.


    custom_palette <- colorRampPalette(c("blue", "white", "red"))(9)

    breaks = c(-1.75, -1.25, -0.75, -0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 1.25, 2)

    

    # Plot using terra's plot function

    plot(dsm_diff, 
         main = "DSM Difference Map", 
         col=custom_palette,
         breaks=breaks,
         axes = TRUE, 
         legend = TRUE)

![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/AOP/Lidar/lidar-uncertainty/rfigs/spatial-distribution-dsm-diff-1.png)
It looks like there is a spatial pattern in the distribution of errors. Now let's take a
look at the statistics (mean, standard deviation), histogram and map for the difference in DTMs.


    # Difference the 2 DTM rasters

    dtm_diff <- dtm1 - dtm2

    

    # Calculate mean and standard deviation

    dtm_diff_mean <- as.numeric(global(dtm_diff, fun = "mean", na.rm = TRUE))

    dtm_diff_std_dev <- as.numeric(global(dtm_diff, fun = "sd", na.rm = TRUE))

    

    # Print the statistics

    print(paste("Mean DTM Difference:", round(dtm_diff_mean,3)))

    ## [1] "Mean DTM Difference: 0.014"

    print(paste("Standard Deviation of DSM Difference:", round(dtm_diff_std_dev,3)))

    ## [1] "Standard Deviation of DSM Difference: 0.102"


    custom_palette <- colorRampPalette(c("blue", "white", "red"))(5)

    breaks = c(-1, -0.6, -0.2, 0.2, 0.6, 1)

    

    plot(dtm_diff, 
         main = "DTM Difference Map", 
         col=custom_palette,
         breaks=breaks,
         axes = TRUE, 
         legend = TRUE)

![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/AOP/Lidar/lidar-uncertainty/rfigs/spatial-distribution-dtm-diff-1.png)
The overall magnitude of differences are smaller than in the DSM but the same 
spatial pattern of the error is evident.

Now, we'll plot the Canopy Height Model (CHM) of the same area. In the CHM, the tree heights above ground are represented, with all ground pixels having zero elevation. This time we'll use a colorbar which shows the ground as light green and the highest vegetation as dark green.


    # Reset the plotting area

    par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

    

    # Plot the CHMs from the 1st and 2nd collections

    plot(chm1, main = "2016_PRIN_1 CHM")

    plot(chm2, main = "2016_PRIN_2 CHM")

![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/AOP/Lidar/lidar-uncertainty/rfigs/plot-chm-1.png)

From the CHM, it appears the spatial distribution of error patterns follow the location of vegetation.

Now let's isolate only the pixels in the difference DSM that correspond to vegetation location, calculate the mean and standard deviation, and plot the associated histogram. Before displaying the histogram, we'll remove the no data values from the difference DSM and the non-zero pixels from the CHM.


    # Create a mask of non-zero values in the CHM raster

    chm_mask <- chm1 != 0

    

    # Apply the veg mask to the DSM difference raster

    dsm_diff_masked_veg <- mask(dsm_diff, chm_mask, maskvalue = FALSE)

    

    # Calculate mean and standard deviation of the DSM difference only using vegetated pixels

    dsm_diff_masked_veg_mean <- as.numeric(global(dsm_diff_masked_veg, fun = "mean", na.rm = TRUE))

    dsm_diff_masked_veg_std_dev <- as.numeric(global(dsm_diff_masked_veg, fun = "sd", na.rm = TRUE))

    

    # Print the statistics

    print(paste("Mean DSM Difference on Veg Pixels:", round(dsm_diff_masked_veg_mean,3)))

    ## [1] "Mean DSM Difference on Veg Pixels: 0.072"

    print(paste("Standard Deviation of DSM Difference on Veg Pixels:", round(dsm_diff_masked_veg_std_dev,3)))

    ## [1] "Standard Deviation of DSM Difference on Veg Pixels: 1.405"


    # Calculate x-axis limits: mean Â± 2 * standard deviation

    masked_xlim_lower <- dsm_diff_masked_veg_mean - 2 * dsm_diff_masked_veg_std_dev

    masked_xlim_upper <- dsm_diff_masked_veg_mean + 2 * dsm_diff_masked_veg_std_dev

    

    # Plot a histogram of the raster values with 100 bins, x-axis set to Â±2 standard deviations

    hist(dsm_diff_masked_veg, breaks = 250, xlim = c(masked_xlim_lower, masked_xlim_upper), 
         main = "Histogram of Difference DSM in Vegetated Areas", xlab = "Height Difference (m)", 
         ylab = "Frequency", col = "lightblue", border = "black")

![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/AOP/Lidar/lidar-uncertainty/rfigs/masked-dsm-histogram-1.png)
The results show a similar mean difference of near zero, but an extremely high standard deviation of 1.381 m! Since the DSM represents the top of the tree canopy, this provides the level of uncertainty we can expect in the canopy height in forests characteristic of the PRIN site using NEON lidar data.

Next we'll calculate the statistics and plot the histogram of the DTM vegetated areas.


    # Apply the veg mask to the DTM difference raster

    dtm_diff_masked_veg <- mask(dtm_diff, chm_mask, maskvalue = FALSE)

    

    # Calculate mean and standard deviation of the dtm difference only using vegetated pixels

    dtm_diff_masked_veg_mean <- as.numeric(global(dtm_diff_masked_veg, fun = "mean", na.rm = TRUE))

    dtm_diff_masked_veg_std_dev <- as.numeric(global(dtm_diff_masked_veg, fun = "sd", na.rm = TRUE))

    

    # Print the statistics

    print(paste("Mean DTM Difference on Veg Pixels:", round(dtm_diff_masked_veg_mean,3)))

    ## [1] "Mean DTM Difference on Veg Pixels: 0.023"

    print(paste("Standard Deviation of DTM Difference on Veg Pixels:", round(dtm_diff_masked_veg_std_dev,3)))

    ## [1] "Standard Deviation of DTM Difference on Veg Pixels: 0.163"
The mean difference is almost zero (0.023 m), and the variation in less than the 
DSM variation (0.163 m). Let's look at the histogram.


    # Calculate x-axis limits: mean Â± 2 * standard deviation

    masked_xlim_lower <- dtm_diff_masked_veg_mean - 2 * dtm_diff_masked_veg_std_dev

    masked_xlim_upper <- dtm_diff_masked_veg_mean + 2 * dtm_diff_masked_veg_std_dev

    

    # Plot a histogram of the raster values with 100 bins, x-axis set to Â±2 standard deviations

    hist(dtm_diff_masked_veg, breaks = 250, xlim = c(masked_xlim_lower, masked_xlim_upper), 
         main = "Histogram of Difference DTM in Vegetated Areas", xlab = "Height Difference (m)", 
         ylab = "Frequency", col = "lightblue", border = "black")

![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/AOP/Lidar/lidar-uncertainty/rfigs/masked-dtm-histogram-1.png)

Although the variation of the DTM is lower than in the DSM, it is still larger 
than expected for lidar. This is because under vegetation there may not be much 
laser energy reaching the ground, and the points that reach the ground may return 
with lower signal. The sparsity of points leads to surface interpolation over 
larger distances, which can miss variations in the topography. Since the 
distribution of lidar points varied on each day, this resulted in different 
terrain representations and an uncertainty in the ground surface. This shows 
that the accuracy of lidar DTMs is reduced when there is vegetation present.

Finally, let's look at the DTM difference on only the ground points (where CHM = 0).


    ground_mask <- chm1 == 0

    

    # Apply the ground mask to the DSM difference raster

    dsm_diff_masked_ground <- mask(dsm_diff, ground_mask, maskvalue = FALSE)

    

    # Calculate mean and standard deviation of the DSM difference only using vegetated pixels

    dsm_diff_masked_ground_mean <- as.numeric(global(dsm_diff_masked_ground, fun = "mean", na.rm = TRUE))

    dsm_diff_masked_ground_std_dev <- as.numeric(global(dsm_diff_masked_ground, fun = "sd", na.rm = TRUE))

    

    # Print the statistics

    print(paste("Mean DSM Difference on Ground Pixels:", round(dsm_diff_masked_ground_mean,4)))

    ## [1] "Mean DSM Difference on Ground Pixels: -0.0002"

    print(paste("Standard Deviation of DSM Difference on Ground Pixels:", round(dsm_diff_masked_ground_std_dev,3)))

    ## [1] "Standard Deviation of DSM Difference on Ground Pixels: 0.21"


    # Calculate x-axis limits: mean Â± 2 * standard deviation

    masked_xlim_lower <- dsm_diff_masked_ground_mean - 2 * dsm_diff_masked_ground_std_dev

    masked_xlim_upper <- dsm_diff_masked_ground_mean + 2 * dsm_diff_masked_ground_std_dev

    

    # Plot a histogram of the raster values with 100 bins, x-axis set to Â±2 standard deviations

    hist(dsm_diff_masked_ground, breaks = 500, xlim = c(masked_xlim_lower, masked_xlim_upper), 
         main = "Histogram of Difference DTM over Ground Pixels", xlab = "Height Difference (m)", 
         ylab = "Frequency", col = "lightblue", border = "black")

![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/AOP/Lidar/lidar-uncertainty/rfigs/dsm-diff-masked-ground-hist-1.png)

In the open ground scenario we are able to see the error characteristics we expect, 
with a mean difference of ~ 0 m and a variation of 0.21 m.

This shows that the uncertainty we expect in the NEON lidar system (~0.15 m) is only 
valid in bare, open, hard-surfaces. We cannot expect the lidar to be as accurate 
when vegetation is present. Quantifying the top of the canopy is particularly 
difficult and can lead to uncertainty in excess of 1 m for any given pixel.
