## About Rasters

For a full tutorial on rasters & raster data, please go through the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/dc-raster-data-r" target="_blank">*Intro to Raster Data in R* tutorial</a>
which provides a foundational concepts even if you aren't working with R.

A raster is a dataset made up of cells or pixels. Each pixel represents a value 
associated with a region on the earthâ€™s surface.

## Creating Surfaces (Rasters) From Points

There are several ways that we can get from the point data collected by lidar to 
the surface data that we want for different Digital Elevation Models or similar
data we use in analyses and mapping. 

Basic gridding does not allow for the recovery/classification of data in any area
where data are missing. Interpolation (including Triangulated Irregular Network 
(TIN) Interpolation) allows for gaps to be covered so that there are not holes 
in the resulting raster surface.  

Interpolation can be done in a number of different ways, some of which are 
deterministic and some are probabilistic.

## Gridding Points

When creating a raster, you may chose to perform a direct **gridding** of the data.
This means that you calculate one value for every cell in the raster where there
are sample points. This value may be a mean of all points, a max, min or some other
mathematical function. All other cells will then have `no data` values associated with
them. This means you may have gaps in your data if the point spacing is not well 
distributed with at least one data point within the spatial coverage of each raster 
cell.

We can create a raster from points through a process called gridding. 
Gridding is the process of taking a set of points and using them to create a 
surface composed of a regular grid.

## Spatial Interpolation

Spatial **interpolation** involves calculating the value for a query point (or 
a raster cell) with an unknown value from a set of known sample point values that 
are distributed across an area. There is a general assumption that points closer 
to the query point are more strongly related to that cell than those farther away.
However this general assumption is applied differently across different 
interpolation functions.

### Deterministic & Probabilistic Interpolators

There are two main types of interpolation approaches:

* **Deterministic**: create surfaces directly from measured points using a 
weighted distance or area function.
* **Probabilistic (Geostatistical)**: utilize the statistical properties of the 
 measured points. Probabilistic techniques quantify the spatial auto-correlation 
 among measured points and account for the spatial configuration of the sample 
 points around the prediction location.

Different methods of interpolation are better for different datasets. This table 
lays out the strengths of some of the more common interpolation methods.

We will focus on deterministic methods in this tutorial.

## Deterministic Interpolation Methods

Let's look at a few different deterministic interpolation methods to understand 
how different methods can affect an output raster.

### Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) 

Inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation calculates the values of a query 
point (a cell with an unknown value) using a linearly weighted combination of values 
from nearby points. 

<figure>
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/geospatial-skills/idw_interpolation_QGIS.png" target="_blank">

    <figcaption>

	query point) using surrounding points with the assumption that closest points 
	will be the most similar to the value of interest. Source: 
	<a href="https://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/_images/idw_interpolation.png" target="_blank">QGIS </a></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Key Attributes of IDW Interpolation

* The raster is derived based upon an assumed linear relationship between the 
location of interest and the distance to surrounding sample points. In other 
words, sample points closest to the cell of interest are assumed to be more related
to its value than those further away.ID
* Bounded/exact estimation, hence can not interpolate beyond the min/max range 
of data point values. This estimate within the range of existing sample point 
values can yield "flattened" peaks and valleys -- especially if the data didn't 
capture those high and low points.
* Interpolated points are average values
* Good for point data that are equally distributed and dense. Assumes a consistent
trend or relationship between points and does not accommodate trends within the 
data(e.g. east to west, elevational, etc).

	and surrounding points. Source: J. Abrecht, CUNY </figcaption>
</figure>


#### Power

The power value changes the "weighting" of the IDW interpolation by specifying 
how strongly points further away from the query point impact the calculated value 
for that point. Power values range from 0-3+ with a default settings generally 
being 2. A larger power value produces a more localized result - values further 
away from the cell have less impact on it's calculated value, values closer to 
the cell impact it's value more. A smaller power value produces a more averaged 
result where sample points further away from the cell have a greater impact on 
the cell's calculated value.

	<figcaption>
	The solid line represents greater power and the dashed line represents lower 
	power. The greater the power, the more localized an affect a sample point's 
	value has on the resulting surface. A smaller power value yields a smoothed 
	or more averaged surface.

</figure>

The impacts of power:

* **lower power values** more averaged result, potential for a smoother surface.
As power decreases, the influence of sample points is larger. This yields a smoother 
surface that is more averaged.

* **greater power values**: more localized result, potential for more peaks and 
valleys around sample point locations. As power increases, the influence of 
sample points falls off more rapidly with distance. The query cell values become 
more localized and less averaged. 


#### IDW Take Home Points

IDW is good for:

* Data whose distribution is strongly (and linearly) correlated with 
distance. For example, noise falls off very predictably with distance. 
* Providing explicit control over the influence of distance (compared to Spline
or Kriging). 

IDW is not so good for:

* Data whose distribution depends on more complex sets of variables
 because it can account only for the effects of distance. 


Other features:

* You can create a smoother surface by decreasing the power, increasing the 
number of sample points used or increasing the search (sample points) radius. 
* You can create a surface that more closely represents the peaks and dips of 
your sample points by decreasing the number of sample points used, decreasing 
the search radius or increasing the power.
* You can increase IDW surface accuracy by adding breaklines to the 
interpolation process that serve as barriers. Breaklines represent abrupt 
changes in elevation, such as cliffs.



### Spline 

Spline interpolation fits a curved surface through the sample points of your 
dataset. Imagine stretching a rubber sheet across your points and gluing it to 
each sample point along the way -- what you get is a smooth stretched sheet with
bumps and valleys. Unlike IDW, spline can estimate values above and 
below the min and max values of your sample points. Thus it is good for estimating 
high and low values not already represented in your data.

</figure>


#### Regularized & Tension Spline

There are two types of curved surfaces that can be fit when using spline 
interpolation:

1. **Tension spline:** a flatter surface that forces estimated values to stay closer
to the known sample points.

2. **Regularized spline:** a more elastic surface that is more likely to estimate above
and below the known sample points.

<a href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/3d-analyst/how-spline-works.htm" target="_blank">*How Splines Work* background materials.</a>


#### Spline Take Home Points

Spline is good for:

* Estimating values outside of the range of sample input data.
* Creating a smooth continuous surface.

Spline is not so good for:

* Points that are close together and have large value differences. Slope calculations can yield over and underestimation.
* Data with large, sudden changes in values that need to be represented (e.g., fault lines, extreme vertical topographic changes, etc). NOTE: some tools like ArcGIS have introduced a spline with barriers function in recent years.


### Natural Neighbor Interpolation

Natural neighbor interpolation finds the closest subset of data points to the 
query point of interest. It then applies weights to those points to calculate an 
average estimated value based upon their proportionate areas derived from their 
corresponding 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram" target="_blank"> Voronoi polygons</a> 
(see figure below for definition). The natural neighbor interpolator adapts 
locally to the input data using points surrounding the query point of interest. 
Thus there is no radius, number of points or other settings needed when using 
this approach.

This interpolation method works equally well on regular and irregularly spaced data.

    <figcaption> A Voronoi diagram is created by taking pairs of points that are close together and drawing a line that is equidistant between them and perpendicular to the line connecting them. Source: Wikipedia 
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Natural neighbor interpolation uses the area of each Voronoi polygon associated 
with the surrounding points to derive a weight that is then used to calculate an 
estimated value for the query point of interest. 

To calculate the weighted area around a query point, a secondary Voronoi diagram 
is created using the immediately neighboring points and mapped on top of the 
original Voronoi diagram created using the known sample points (image below).

#### Natural Neighbor Take Home Points


Natural Neighbor Interpolation is good for:

* Data where spatial distribution is variable (and data that are equally distributed).
* Categorical data.
* Providing a smoother output raster.

Natural Neighbor Interpolation is not as good for:

* Data where the interpolation needs to be spatially constrained (to a particular number of points of distance). 
* Data where sample points further away from or beyond the immediate "neighbor points" need to be considered in the estimation.

Other features:

* Good as a local interpolator
* Interpolated values fall within the range of values of the sample data
* Surface passes through input samples; not above or below
* Supports breaklines

### Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN)

The Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) is a vector based surface where sample
points (nodes) are connected by a series of edges creating a triangulated surface.
The TIN format remains the most true to the point distribution, density and 
spacing of a dataset. It also may yield the largest file size!
