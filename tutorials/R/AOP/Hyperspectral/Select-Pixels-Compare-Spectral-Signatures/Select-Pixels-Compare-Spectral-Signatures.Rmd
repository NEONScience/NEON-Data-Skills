### Data to Download

These hyperspectral remote sensing data provide information on the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/" target="_blank"> National Ecological Observatory Network's</a> <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/SJER" target="_blank" >San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER)</a> field site in March of 2021. The data used in this lesson is the 1km by 1km mosaic tile named NEON_D17_SJER_DP3_257000_4112000_reflectance.h5. If you already completed the previous lesson in this tutorial series, you do not need to download this data again. The entire SJER reflectance dataset can be accessed from the <a href="http://data.neonscience.org" target="_blank">NEON Data Portal</a>.


**Set Working Directory:** This lesson assumes that you have set your working directory to the location of the downloaded data. 

<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/set-working-directory-r" target="_blank"> An overview of setting the working directory in R can be found here.</a>


### Recommended Skills

This tutorial will require that you be comfortable navigating HDF5 files, and have an understanding of what spectral signatures are. For additional information on these topics, we highly recommend you work through the earlier tutorials in this <a href="https://neonscience.org/intro-hsi-r-series" target="_blank"> *Introduction to Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data* series</a> before starting on this tutorial.

</div>


## Getting Started

First, we need to load our required packages and set the working directory.

```{r load-libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# load required packages
library(rhdf5)
library(reshape2)
library(terra)
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(grDevices)

# set working directory, you can change this if desired
wd <- "~/data/" 
setwd(wd)
```

Download the reflectance tile, if you haven't already, using `neonUtilities::byTileAOP`:

``` {r download-h5, eval=FALSE}
byTileAOP(dpID = 'DP3.30006.001',
          site = 'SJER',
          year = '2021',
          easting = 257500,
          northing = 4112500,
          savepath = wd)
```

And then we can read in the hyperspectral hdf5 data. We will also collect a few other important pieces of information (band wavelengths and scaling factor) while we're at it.

``` {r read-h5}
# define filepath to the hyperspectral dataset
h5_file <- paste0(wd,"DP3.30006.001/neon-aop-products/2021/FullSite/D17/2021_SJER_5/L3/Spectrometer/Reflectance/NEON_D17_SJER_DP3_257000_4112000_reflectance.h5")

# read in the wavelength information from the HDF5 file
wavelengths <- h5read(h5_file,"/SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Spectral_Data/Wavelength")

# grab scale factor from the Reflectance attributes
reflInfo <- h5readAttributes(h5_file,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data" )

scaleFact <- reflInfo$Scale_Factor
```

Now, we will read in the RGB image that we created in an earlier tutorial and plot it. 

```{r read-in-RGB-and-plot, fig.cap="RGB image of a portion of the SJER field site using 3 bands from the raster stack. Brightness values have been stretched using the stretch argument to produce a natural looking image."}

# read in RGB image as a 'stack' rather than a plain 'raster'
rgbStack <- rast(paste0(wd,"NEON_hyperspectral_tutorial_example_RGB_image.tif"))

# plot as RGB image, with a linear stretch
plotRGB(rgbStack,
        r=1,g=2,b=3, scale=300, 
        stretch = "lin")
```

## Interactive `click` Function from the `terra` Package

Next, we use an interactive clicking function to identify the pixels that we want to extract spectral signatures for. To follow along with this tutorial, we suggest the following six cover types (exact locations shown in the image below). 

1. Water
2. Tree canopy (avoid the shaded northwestern side of the tree)
3. Irrigated grass
4. Bare soil (baseball diamond infield)
5. Building roof (blue)
6. Road

As shown here:

    alt="RGB image of a portion of the SJER field site using 3 bands from the raster stack. Also displayed are points labeled with numbers one through six, representing six land cover types selected using the interactive click function from the raster package. These are: 1. Water, 2. Tree Canopy, 3. Grass, 4. Soil (Baseball Diamond), 5. Building Roof, and 6. Road. Plotting parameters have been changed to enhance visibility.">

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Note from the `terra::click` Description (which you can see by typing `help("click")`: "This does not work well on the default RStudio plotting device. To work around that, you can first run `dev.new(noRStudioGD = TRUE)` which will create a separate window for plotting, then use `plot()` followed by `click()` and click on the map."

</div>

For this next part, if you are following along in RStudio, you will need to enter these lines directly in the Console. `dev.new(noRStudioGD = TRUE)` will open up a separate window for plotting, where you will also run the `click` command.

```{r dev-new, eval=FALSE}
dev.new(noRStudioGD = TRUE)
```

Now we can create our RGB plot, and start clicking on this new Graphics window.

```{r click-to-select, eval=FALSE, comment=NA}

# change plotting parameters to better see the points and numbers generated from clicking
par(col="red", cex=2)

# use a histogram stretch in order to provide more contrast for selecting pixels
plotRGB(rgbStack, r=1, g=2, b=3, scale=300, stretch = "hist") 

# use the 'click' function
c <- click(rgbStack, n = 7, id=TRUE, xy=TRUE, cell=TRUE, type="p", pch=16, col="red", col.lab="red")

```

Once you have clicked your six points, the graphics window should close. If you want to choose new points, or if you accidentally clicked something you didn't want to in the step, run the previous chunk of code again to start over.

```{r create-c-hidden, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
c <- read.csv("./click_df.csv")
```

The `click()` function identifies the cell number that you clicked, but in order to extract spectral signatures, we need to convert that cell number into a row and column, as shown here:

```{r convert-cell-to-row-column}
# convert raster cell number into row and column (used to extract spectral signature below)
c$row <- c$cell%/%nrow(rgbStack)+1 # add 1 because R is 1-indexed
c$col <- c$cell%%ncol(rgbStack)
```

## Extract Spectral Signatures from HDF5 file
Next, we will loop through each of the cells that and use the `h5read()` function to extract the reflectance values of all bands from the given pixel (row and column). 

```{r extract-spectral-signaures}

# create a new dataframe from the band wavelengths so that we can add the reflectance values for each cover type
pixel_df <- as.data.frame(wavelengths)

# loop through each of the cells that we selected
for(i in 1:length(c$cell)){
# extract spectral values from a single pixel
aPixel <- h5read(h5_file,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data",
                 index=list(NULL,c$col[i],c$row[i]))

# scale reflectance values from 0-1
aPixel <- aPixel/as.vector(scaleFact)

# reshape the data and turn into dataframe
b <- adply(aPixel,c(1))

# rename the column that we just created
names(b)[2] <- paste0("Point_",i)

# add reflectance values for this pixel to our combined data.frame called pixel_df
pixel_df <- cbind(pixel_df,b[2])
}

```

## Plot Spectral signatures using ggplot2
Finally, we have everything that we need to plot the spectral signatures for each of the pixels that we clicked. In order to color our lines by the different land cover types, we will first reshape our data using the `melt()` function, then plot the spectral signatures.

1. Water
2. Tree canopy (avoid the shaded northwestern side of the tree)
3. Irrigated grass
4. Bare soil (baseball diamond infield)
5. Building roof (blue)
6. Road

```{r plot-spectral-signatures, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Plot of spectral signatures for the six different land cover types: Water, Tree, Grass, Soil, Roof, and Road. The x-axis is wavelength in nanometers and the y-axis is reflectance."}
# Use the melt() function to reshape the dataframe into a format that ggplot prefers
pixel.melt <- reshape2::melt(pixel_df, id.vars = "wavelengths", value.name = "Reflectance")

# Now, let's plot some spectral signatures!
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data = pixel.melt, mapping = aes(x=wavelengths, y=Reflectance, color=variable), lwd=1.5)+
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("blue3","green4","green2","tan4","grey50","black"),
                      labels = c("Water","Tree","Grass","Soil","Roof","Road"))+
  labs(color = "Cover Type")+
  ggtitle("Land cover spectral signatures")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=20))+
  xlab("Wavelength")
```

Nice! However, there seems to be something weird going on in the wavelengths near ~1400nm and ~1850 nm...

## Atmospheric Absorption Bands 
Those irregularities around 1400nm and 1850 nm are two major atmospheric absorption bands - regions where gasses in the atmosphere (primarily carbon dioxide and water vapor) absorb radiation, and therefore, obscure the reflected radiation that the imaging spectrometer measures. Fortunately, the lower and upper bound of each of those atmospheric absorption bands is specified in the HDF5 file. Let's read those bands and plot rectangles where the reflectance measurements are obscured by atmospheric absorption. 

```{r mask-atmospheric-absorption-bands, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Plot of spectral signatures for the six different land cover types: Water, Tree, Grass, Soil, Roof, and Road. Added to the plot are two greyed-out rectangles in regions near 1400nm and 1850nm where the reflectance measurements are obscured by atmospheric absorption. The x-axis is wavelength in nanometers and the y-axis is reflectance."}

# grab reflectance metadata (which contains absorption band limits)
reflMetadata <- h5readAttributes(h5_file,"/SJER/Reflectance" )

ab1 <- reflMetadata$Band_Window_1_Nanometers
ab2 <- reflMetadata$Band_Window_2_Nanometers

# Plot spectral signatures again with rectangles showing the absorption bands
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data = pixel.melt, mapping = aes(x=wavelengths, y=Reflectance, color=variable), lwd=1.5)+
  geom_rect(mapping=aes(ymin=min(pixel.melt$Reflectance),ymax=max(pixel.melt$Reflectance), xmin=ab1[1], xmax=ab1[2]), color="black", fill="grey40", alpha=0.8)+
  geom_rect(mapping=aes(ymin=min(pixel.melt$Reflectance),ymax=max(pixel.melt$Reflectance), xmin=ab2[1], xmax=ab2[2]), color="black", fill="grey40", alpha=0.8)+
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("blue3","green4","green2","tan4","grey50","black"),
                      labels = c("Water","Tree","Grass","Soil","Roof","Road"))+
  labs(color = "Cover Type")+
  ggtitle("Land cover spectral signatures")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=20))+
  xlab("Wavelength")
```

Now we can clearly see that the noisy sections of each spectral signature are within the atmospheric absorption bands. For our final step, let's take all reflectance values from within each absorption band and set them to `NA` to remove the noisiest sections from the plot.

```{r remove-absorption-band-reflectances, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Plot of spectral signatures for the six different land cover types. Values falling within the two rectangles from the previous image have been set to NA and ommited from the plot. The x-axis is wavelength in nanometers and the y-axis is reflectance."}

# Duplicate the spectral signatures into a new data.frame
pixel.melt.masked <- pixel.melt

# Mask out all values within each of the two atmospheric absorption bands
pixel.melt.masked[pixel.melt.masked$wavelengths>ab1[1]&pixel.melt.masked$wavelengths<ab1[2],]$Reflectance <- NA
pixel.melt.masked[pixel.melt.masked$wavelengths>ab2[1]&pixel.melt.masked$wavelengths<ab2[2],]$Reflectance <- NA

# Plot the masked spectral signatures
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data = pixel.melt.masked, mapping = aes(x=wavelengths, y=Reflectance, color=variable), lwd=1.5)+
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("blue3","green4","green2","tan4","grey50","black"),
                      labels = c("Water","Tree","Grass","Soil","Roof","Road"))+
  labs(color = "Cover Type")+
  ggtitle("Land cover spectral signatures")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=20))+
  xlab("Wavelength")

```

There you have it, spectral signatures for six different land cover types, with the readings from the atmospheric absorption bands removed.

### Challenge: Compare Spectral Signatures

There are many interesting comparisons to make with spectral signatures. 
Try these challenges to explore hyperspectral data further:

1. Compare six different types of vegetation, and pick an appropriate color for each of their lines. A nice guide to the many different color options in R can be found <a href="http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour" target="_blank"> *here*.</a>

2. What happens if you only click five points? What about ten? How does this change the spectral signature plots, and can you fix any errors that occur?

3. Does shallow water have a different spectral signature than deep water?

</div>


```{r challenge-answer, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

# Challenge Answers - These challenge problems will depend on the specific
# pixels that you select, but here we answer these questions generally.

# 1. Each vegetation class will likely have slightly different spectral signatures, 
# mostly distinguished by the amplitude of the near-IR bands. As we saw in this 
# tutorial, irrigated grass has a much higher reflectance in the near-IR than 
# does the tree canopy. In general, grasses and irrigated vegetation have a higher 
# reflectance than do natural vegetation, and deciduous trees higher than conifers.

# 2. If you click four points, the script should work, but the plot labels and 
# colors might be wrong (for example, if you skip the soil point, your water point 
# may have the soil color and label). If you click six points, you will get an error
# that the ggplot function needs six colors and labels in the scale_color_manual() 
# function. You can simply add the appropriate color and label for your sixth point 
# if you want!

# 3. Yes, shallow water usually has a different spectral signature than deep water. 
# This is because shallow water actually reflects some light from the soil at the 
# bottom of the water column, so the resulting spectral signature will look like 
# a combination of bare soil and water. 

```
