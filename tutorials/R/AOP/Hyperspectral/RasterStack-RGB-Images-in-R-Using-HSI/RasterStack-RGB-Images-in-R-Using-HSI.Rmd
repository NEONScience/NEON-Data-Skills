In this tutorial, we will learn how to create multi (3) band images from hyperspectral 
data. We will also learn how to perform some basic raster calculations 
(known as raster math in the GIS world).

<div id="ds-objectives" markdown="1">

## Learning Objectives

After completing this activity, you will be able to:

* Extract a "slice" of data from a hyperspectral data cube.
* Create a rasterstack in R which can then be used to create RGB images from bands in a hyperspectral data cube.
* Plot data spatially on a map.
* Create basic vegetation indices like NDVI using raster-based calculations in R.

## Things You’ll Need To Complete This Tutorial
To complete this tutorial you will need the most current version of R and, 
preferably, RStudio loaded on your computer.

### R Libraries to Install:

* **rhdf5**: `install.packages("BiocManager")`, `BiocManager::install("rhdf5")`
* **raster**: `install.packages('raster')`

### Data to Download

<h3><a href="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/21754221">
Download NEON Teaching Data Subset: Imaging Spectrometer Data - HDF5 </a></h3>

These hyperspectral remote sensing data provide information on the
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/" target="_blank"> National Ecological Observatory Network's</a> 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/SJER" target="_blank" > San Joaquin 
Exerimental Range field site</a> in March of 2019.
The data were collected over the San Joaquin field site located in California 
(Domain 17) and processed at NEON headquarters. This data subset is derived from 
the mosaic tile named NEON_D17_SJER_DP3_257000_4112000_reflectance.h5. 
The entire dataset can be accessed by request from the 
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org" target="_blank"> NEON Data Portal</a>.

<a href="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/21754221" class="link--button link--arrow">
Download Dataset</a>

**Remember** that the example dataset linked here only has 1 out of every 4 bands
included in a full NEON hyperspectral dataset (this substantially reduces the file 
size!). When we refer to bands in this tutorial, we will note the band numbers for 
this example dataset, which are different from NEON production data. To convert 
a band number (b) from this example data subset to the equivalent band in a full 
NEON hyperspectral file (b'), use the following equation: b' = 1+4*(b-1).





***
**Set Working Directory:** This lesson assumes that you have set your working 
directory to the location of the downloaded and unzipped data subsets. 

<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/set-working-directory-r" target="_blank"> An overview
of setting the working directory in R can be found here.</a>

**R Script & Challenge Code:** NEON data lessons often contain challenges that reinforce 
learned skills. If available, the code for challenge solutions is found in the
downloadable R script of the entire lesson, available in the footer of each lesson page.


### Recommended Skills

For this tutorial you should be comfortable working with HDF5 files that 
contain hyperspectral data, including reading in reflectance values and 
associated metadata and attributes. 

If you aren't familiar with these steps already, we highly recommend you work 
through the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/hsi-hdf5-r" target="_blank"> 
*Introduction to Working with Hyperspectral Data in HDF5 Format in R* tutorial</a>
before moving on to this tutorial.

## About Hyperspectral Data 
We often want to generate a 3 band image from multi or hyperspectral data. The 
most commonly recognized band combination is RGB which stands for Red, Green and 
Blue. RGB images are just like the images that your camera takes. But there are 
other band combinations that are useful too. For example, near infrared images 
emphasize vegetation and help us classify or identify where vegetation is located 
on the ground.

## Create a Raster Stack in R

In the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/hsi-hdf5-r" target="_blank">previous activity</a>, 
we exported a single band of the NEON Reflectance data from a HDF5 file. In this 
activity, we will create a full color image using 3 (red, green and blue - RGB) 
bands. We will follow many of the steps we followed in the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/hsi-hdf5-r" target="_blank">Intro to Working with Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data in HDF5 Format in R</a> tutorial. 
These steps included loading required packages, reading in our file and viewing 
the file structure.

```{r load-libraries}

# Load required packages
library(raster)
library(rhdf5)

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where
# we want to save our files. Be sure to move the download into your working directory!
wd <- "~/Documents/data/" # This will depend on your local environment
setwd(wd)

# create path to file name
f <- paste0(wd,"NEON_hyperspectral_tutorial_example_subset.h5")

```

```{r view-file-structure, eval=FALSE, comment=NA}
# View HDF5 file structure 
View(h5ls(f,all=T))

```

To spatially locate our raster data, we need a few key attributes:

* The coordinate reference system
* The spatial extent of the raster
   
We'll begin by grabbing these key attributes from the H5 file.   

```{r get-spatial-attributes }

# define coordinate reference system from the EPSG code provided in the HDF5 file
myEPSG <- h5read(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Coordinate_System/EPSG Code" )
myCRS <- crs(paste0("+init=epsg:",myEPSG))

# get the Reflectance_Data attributes
reflInfo <- h5readAttributes(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data" )

# Grab the UTM coordinates of the spatial extent
xMin <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[1]
xMax <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[2]
yMin <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[3]
yMax <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[4]

# define the extent (left, right, top, bottom)
rasExt <- extent(xMin,xMax,yMin,yMax)

# view the extent to make sure that it looks right
rasExt

# Finally, define the no data value for later
myNoDataValue <- as.integer(reflInfo$Data_Ignore_Value)
myNoDataValue
```

Next, we'll write a function that will perform the processing that we did step by 
step in the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/hsi-hdf5-r" target="_blank">Intro to Working with Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data in HDF5 Format in R</a>.
This will allow us to process multiple bands in bulk.

The function `band2Rast` slices a band of data from the HDF5 file, and
extracts the reflectance. It then converts the data into a matrix, converts it to
a raster, and finally returns a spatially corrected raster for the specified band. 

The function requires the following variables:

* file: the file
* band: the band number we wish to extract
* noDataValue: the noDataValue for the raster
* extent: a raster `Extent` object .
* crs: the Coordinate Reference System for the raster

The function output is a spatially referenced, R raster object.

```{r function-read-refl-data }

# file: the hdf file
# band: the band you want to process
# returns: a matrix containing the reflectance data for the specific band

band2Raster <- function(file, band, noDataValue, extent, CRS){
    # first, read in the raster
    out <- h5read(file,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data",index=list(band,NULL,NULL))
	  # Convert from array to matrix
	  out <- (out[1,,])
	  # transpose data to fix flipped row and column order 
    # depending upon how your data are formatted you might not have to perform this
    # step.
	  out <- t(out)
    # assign data ignore values to NA
    # note, you might chose to assign values of 15000 to NA
    out[out == myNoDataValue] <- NA
	  
    # turn the out object into a raster
    outr <- raster(out,crs=CRS)
   
    # assign the extents to the raster
    extent(outr) <- extent
   
    # return the raster object
    return(outr)
}

```


Now that the function is created, we can create our list of rasters. The list 
specifies which bands (or dimensions in our hyperspectral dataset) we want to 
include in our raster stack. Let's start with a typical RGB (red, green, blue) 
combination. We will use bands 14, 9, and 4 (bands 58, 34, and 19 in a full 
NEON hyperspectral dataset).

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**Data Tip - wavelengths and bands:** Remember that 
you can look at the wavelengths dataset in the HDF5 file to determine the center 
wavelength value for each band. Keep in mind that this data subset only includes
every fourth band that is available in a full NEON hyperspectral dataset!
</div>


```{r create-raster-stack }

# create a list of the bands we want in our stack
rgb <- list(14,9,4) #list(58,34,19) when using full NEON hyperspectral dataset

# lapply tells R to apply the function to each element in the list
rgb_rast <- lapply(rgb,FUN=band2Raster, file = f,
                   noDataValue=myNoDataValue, 
                   extent=rasExt,
                   CRS=myCRS)

# check out the properties or rgb_rast
# note that it displays properties of 3 rasters.
rgb_rast

# finally, create a raster stack from our list of rasters
rgbStack <- stack(rgb_rast)

```

In the code chunk above, we used the `lapply()` function, which is a powerful,
flexible way to apply a function (in this case, our `band2Raster()` fucntion)
multiple times. You can <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/using-apply-sapply-lapply-in-r/" target="_blank">learn more about lapply() here</a>. 

NOTE: We are using the `raster stack` object in R to store several rasters that 
are of the same CRS and extent. This is a popular and convenient way to organize 
co-incident rasters.

Next, add the names of the bands to the raster so we can easily keep track of 
the bands in the list.

```{r plot-raster-stack, fig.cap="Raster plot of band 14 from the raster stack created. The x-axis and y-axis values represent the extent, which range from 257500 to 258000 meters easting, and 4112500 to 4113000 meters northing, respectively. The plot legend depicts the range of reflectance values, which go from 0 to 0.8."}

# Create a list of band names
bandNames <- paste("Band_",unlist(rgb),sep="")

# set the rasterStack's names equal to the list of bandNames created above
names(rgbStack) <- bandNames

# check properties of the raster list - note the band names
rgbStack

# scale the data as specified in the reflInfo$Scale Factor
rgbStack <- rgbStack/as.integer(reflInfo$Scale_Factor)

# plot one raster in the stack to make sure things look OK.
plot(rgbStack$Band_14, main="Band 14")

	
```

We can play with the color ramps too if we want:

```{r plot-HSI-raster, fig.cap=c("Raster plot of band 14 from the raster stack created using different colors available from the terrain.colors funtion. The x-axis and y-axis values represent the extent, which range from 257500 to 258000 meters easting, and 4112500 to 4113000 meters northing, respectively.","Raster plot of band 14 from the raster stack created with a 0.5 adjustment of the z plane, which causes the image to be stretched. The x-axis and y-axis values represent the extent, which range from 257500 to 25800 meters easting, and 4112500 to 4113000 meters northing, respectively. The plot legend depicts the range of reflectance values, which go from 0 to 0.8.","Raster plot of band 14 from the raster stack created using a different color palette. The x-axis and y-axis values represent the extent, which range from 257500 to 258000 meters easting, and 4112500 to 4113000 meters northing, respectively.")}

# change the colors of our raster 
myCol <- terrain.colors(25)
image(rgbStack$Band_14, main="Band 14", col=myCol)

# adjust the zlims or the stretch of the image
myCol <- terrain.colors(25)
image(rgbStack$Band_14, main="Band 14", col=myCol, zlim = c(0,.5))

# try a different color palette
myCol <- topo.colors(15, alpha = 1)
image(rgbStack$Band_14, main="Band 14", col=myCol, zlim=c(0,.5))

```


The `plotRGB` function allows you to combine three bands to create an image. 


```{r plot-RGB-Image, fig.cap="RGB image of a portion of the SJER field site using 3 bands fom the raster stack. Brightness values have been stretched using the stretch argument to produce a natural looking image."}
# create a 3 band RGB image
plotRGB(rgbStack,
        r=1,g=2,b=3,
        stretch = "lin")

```

<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**A note about image stretching:** Notice that we use the argument
`stretch="lin"` in this plotting function, which automatically stretches the 
brightness values for us to produce a natural-looking image.


Once you've created your raster, you can export it as a GeoTIFF. You can bring 
this GeoTIFF into any GIS program!

```{r save-raster-geotiff, eval=FALSE, comment=NA}

# write out final raster	
# note: if you set overwrite to TRUE, then you will overwite or lose the older
# version of the tif file! Keep this in mind.
writeRaster(rgbStack, file=paste0(wd,"NEON_hyperspectral_tutorial_example_RGB_stack_image.tif"), format="GTiff", overwrite=TRUE)

```

### Challenge: Other band combinations

Use different band combinations to create other "RGB" images. Suggested band 
combinations are below for use with the full NEON hyperspectral reflectance 
datasets (for this example dataset, divide the band number by 4 and round to 
the nearest whole number):

* Color Infrared/False Color: rgb (90,34,19)
* SWIR, NIR, Red Band: rgb (152,90,58)
* False Color: rgb (363,246,55)

## Raster Math - Creating NDVI and other Vegetation Indices in R
In this last part, we will calculate some vegetation indices using raster math 
in R! We will start by creating NDVI or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. 

### About NDVI

NDVI is  a ratio between 
the near infrared (NIR) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and the red 
portion of the spectrum. Please keep in mind that there are different ways to 
aggregate bands when using hyperspectral data. This example is using individual 
bands to perform the NDVI calculation. Using individual bands is not necessarily 
the best way to calculate NDVI from hyperspectral data! 

```{r create-NDVI, fig.cap=c("Raster plot of a portion of the SJER field site showing calculated NDVI values. The x-axis and y-axis values represent the extent, which range from 257500 to 258000 meters easting, and 4112500 to 4113000 meters northing, respectively. Plot legend goes from -1 to 1.","Raster plot of a portion of the SJER field site showing calculated NDVI values with predefined breaks at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 05, and 1. The x-axis and y-axis values represent the extent, which range from 257500 to 258000 meters easting, and 4112500 to 4113000 meters northing, respectively. Plot legend goes from 0 to 1.")  }

# Calculate NDVI
# select bands to use in calculation (red, NIR)
ndvi_bands <- c(16,24) #bands c(58,90) in full NEON hyperspectral dataset

# create raster list and then a stack using those two bands
ndvi_rast <- lapply(ndvi_bands,FUN=band2Raster, file = f,
                   noDataValue=myNoDataValue, 
                   extent=rasExt, CRS=myCRS)
ndvi_stack <- stack(ndvi_rast)

# make the names pretty
bandNDVINames <- paste("Band_",unlist(ndvi_bands),sep="")
names(ndvi_stack) <- bandNDVINames

# view the properties of the new raster stack
ndvi_stack

#calculate NDVI
NDVI <- function(x) {
	  (x[,2]-x[,1])/(x[,2]+x[,1])
}
ndvi_calc <- calc(ndvi_stack,NDVI)
plot(ndvi_calc, main="NDVI for the NEON SJER Field Site")

# Now, play with breaks and colors to create a meaningful map
# add a color map with 4 colors
myCol <- rev(terrain.colors(4)) # use the 'rev()' function to put green as the highest NDVI value
# add breaks to the colormap, including lowest and highest values (4 breaks = 3 segments)
brk <- c(0, .25, .5, .75, 1)

# plot the image using breaks
plot(ndvi_calc, main="NDVI for the NEON SJER Field Site", col=myCol, breaks=brk)

```

	
<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
### Challenge: Work with Indices

Try the following:

1. Calculate EVI using the following formula : 
EVI<- 2.5 * ((b4-b3) / (b4 + 6 * b3- 7.5*b1 + 1))

2. Calculate Normalized Difference Nitrogen Index (NDNI) using the following equation: 
log(1/p1510)-log(1/p1680)/ log(1/p1510)+log(1/p1680)

3. Explore the bands in the hyperspectral data. What happens if you average 
reflectance values across multiple red and NIR bands and then calculate NDVI?
