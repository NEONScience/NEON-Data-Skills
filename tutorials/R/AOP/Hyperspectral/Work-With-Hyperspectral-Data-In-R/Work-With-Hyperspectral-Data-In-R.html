<p><strong>Remember</strong> that the example dataset linked here only has 1 out of every 4 bands
included in a full NEON hyperspectral dataset (this substantially reduces the file
size!). When we refer to bands in this tutorial, we will note the band numbers for
this example dataset, which are different from NEON production data. To convert
a band number (b) from this example data subset to the equivalent band in a full
NEON hyperspectral file (b’), use the following equation: b’ = 1+4*(b-1).</p>

<h2 id="about-hyperspectral-remote-sensing-data">About Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data</h2>
<p>The electromagnetic spectrum is composed of thousands of bands representing
different types of light energy. Imaging spectrometers (instruments that collect
hyperspectral data) break the electromagnetic spectrum into groups of bands that
support classification of objects by their spectral properties on the Earth’s
surface. Hyperspectral data consists of many bands - up to hundreds of bands -
that cover the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>The NEON imaging spectrometer (NIS) collects data within the 380 nm to 2510 nm
portions of the electromagnetic spectrum within bands that are approximately 5 nm
in width. This results in a hyperspectral data cube that contains approximately
428 bands - which means BIG DATA. <em>Remember</em> that the example dataset used
here only has 1 out of every 4 bands included in a full NEON hyperspectral dataset
(this substantially reduces size!). When we refer to bands in this tutorial,
we will note the band numbers for this example dataset, which may be different
from NEON production data.</p>

</figure>
<p>The HDF5 data model natively compresses data stored within it (makes it smaller)
and supports data slicing (extracting only the portions of the data that you
need to work with rather than reading the entire dataset into memory). These
features in addition to the ability to support spatial data and associated
metadata make it ideal for working with large data cubes such as those generated
by imaging spectrometers.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we will explore reading and extracting spatial raster data
stored within a HDF5 file using R.</p>
<h2 id="read-hdf5-data-into-r">Read HDF5 data into R</h2>
<p>We will use the <code>raster</code> and <code>rhdf5</code> packages to read in the HDF5 file that
contains hyperspectral data for the
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/SJER" target="_blank">NEON San Joaquin (SJER) field site</a>.
Let’s start by calling the needed packages and reading in our NEON HDF5 file.</p>
<p>Please be sure that you have <em>at least</em> version 2.10 of <code>rhdf5</code> installed. Use:
<code>packageVersion(&quot;rhdf5&quot;)</code> to check the package version.</p>
<pre><code># Load `terra` and `rhdf5` packages to read NIS data into R

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<p><i class="fa fa-star"></i> <strong>Data Tip:</strong> To update all packages installed in
R, use <code>update.packages()</code>.</p>
</div>
<pre><code># set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where

# we want to save our files. Be sure to move the download into your working directory!

# Define the h5 file name to be opened

f &lt;- paste0(wd,&quot;NEON_hyperspectral_tutorial_example_subset.h5&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>You can use <code>h5ls</code> and/or <code>View(h5ls(...))</code> to look at the contents of the hdf5 file, as follows:</p>
<pre><code># look at the HDF5 file structure 

View(h5ls(f,all=T))
</code></pre>
<p>When you look at the structure of the data, take note of the “map info” dataset,
the “Coordinate_System” group, and the “wavelength” and “Reflectance” datasets. The
“Coordinate_System” folder contains the spatial attributes of the data including its
EPSG Code, which is easily converted to a Coordinate Reference System (CRS).
The CRS documents how the data are physically located on the Earth. The “wavelength”
dataset contains the middle wavelength values for each band in the data. The
“Reflectance” dataset contains the image data that we will use for both data processing
and visualization.</p>

<p><i class="fa fa-star"></i><strong>Data Tip - HDF5 Structure:</strong> Note that the structure
of individual HDF5 files may vary depending on who produced the data. In this
case, the Wavelength and reflectance data within the file are both h5 warndatasets.
However, the spatial information is contained within a group. Data downloaded from
another organization (like NASA) may look different. This is why it’s important to
explore the data as a first step!</p>
</div>
<p>We can use the <code>h5readAttributes()</code> function to read and extract metadata from the
HDF5 file. Let’s start by learning about the wavelengths described within this file.</p>

<p>Next, we can use the <code>h5read</code> function to read the data contained within the
HDF5 file. Let’s read in the wavelengths of the band centers:</p>
<pre><code># read in the wavelength information from the HDF5 file

<p>(Hint: look at the wavelengths
vector that we just imported and check out the data located at index 6 -
<code>wavelengths[6]</code>).</p>

</figure>
<p>Band 6 has a associate wavelength center of 481.7032 nanometers (nm) which is
in the blue portion of the visible electromagnetic spectrum (~ 400-700 nm).</p>
<h3 id="bands-and-wavelengths">Bands and Wavelengths</h3>
<p>A <em>band</em> represents
a group of wavelengths. For example, the wavelength values between 695 nm and 700 nm
might be one band as captured by an imaging spectrometer. The imaging spectrometer
collects reflected light energy in a pixel for light in that band. Often when you
work with a multi or hyperspectral dataset, the band information is reported as
the center wavelength value. This value represents the center point value of the
wavelengths represented in that  band. Thus in a band spanning 695-700 nm, the
center would be 697.5 nm). The full width half max (FWHM) will also be reported.
This value represents the spread of the band around that center point. So, a band
that covers 800 nm-805 nm might have a FWHM of 5 nm and a wavelength value of
802.5 nm.</p>

</figure>
<p>The HDF5 dataset that we are working with in this activity may contain more
information than we need to work with. For example, we don’t necessarily need
to process all 107 bands available in this example dataset (or all 426 bands
available in a full NEON hyperspectral reflectance file, for that matter)</p>
<ul>
<li>if we are interested in creating a product like NDVI which only uses bands in
the near infra-red and red portions of the spectrum. Or we might only be interested
in a spatial subset of the data - perhaps a region where we have plots in the field.</li>
</ul>
<p>The HDF5 format allows us to slice (or subset) the data - quickly extracting the
subset that we need to process. Let’s extract one of the green bands in our
dataset - band 9.</p>
<p>By the way - what is the center wavelength value associated
with band 9?</p>
<p>Hint: <code>wavelengths[9]</code>.</p>
<p>How do we know this band is a green band in the visible portion of the spectrum?</p>
<p>In order to effectively subset our data, let’s first read the important
reflectance metadata stored as <em>attributes</em> in the “Reflectance_Data” dataset.</p>

<p>The HDF5 read function reads data in the order: Bands, Cols, Rows. This is
different from how R reads data. We’ll adjust for this later.</p>

<h3 id="a-note-about-data-slicing-in-hdf5">A Note About Data Slicing in HDF5</h3>
<p>Data slicing allows us to extract and work with subsets of the data rather than
reading in the entire dataset into memory. Thus, in this case, we can extract and
plot the green band without reading in all 107 bands of information. The ability
to slice large datasets makes HDF5 ideal for working with big data.</p>
<p>Next, let’s convert our data from an array (more than 2 dimensions) to a matrix
(just 2 dimensions). We need to have our data in a matrix format to plot it.</p>
<pre><code># convert from array to matrix by selecting only the first band

b9 &lt;- b9[1,,]



# check it

class(b9)

## [1] &quot;matrix&quot; &quot;array&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="arrays-vs-matrices">Arrays vs. Matrices</h3>
<p>Arrays are matrices with more than 2 dimensions. When we say dimension, we are
talking about the “z”
associated with the data (imagine a series of tabs in a spreadsheet). Put the other
way: matrices are arrays with only 2 dimensions. Arrays can have any number of
dimensions one, two, ten or more.</p>
<p>Here is a matrix that is 4 x 3 in size (4 rows and 3 columns):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Metric</th>
<th>species 1</th>
<th>species 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>total number</td>
<td>23</td>
<td>45</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>average weight</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>average length</td>
<td>2.4</td>
<td>3.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>average height</td>
<td>32</td>
<td>12</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="dimensions-in-arrays">Dimensions in Arrays</h3>
<p>An array contains 1 or more dimensions in the “z” direction. For example, let’s
say that we collected the same set of species data for every day in a 30 day month.
We might then have a matrix like the one above for each day for a total of 30 days
making a 4 x 3 x 30 array (this dataset has more than 2 dimensions). More on R object
types <a href="http://www.statmethods.net/input/datatypes.html">here</a>

<p>Next, let’s look at the metadata for the reflectance data. When we do this, take
note of 1) the scale factor and 2) the data ignore value. Then we can plot the
band 9 data. Plotting spatial data as a visual “data check” is a good idea to
make sure processing is being performed correctly and all is well with the image.</p>

<p>What do you notice about the first image? It’s washed out and lacking any detail. What
could be causing this? It got better when plotting the log of the values, but
still not great.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the distribution of reflectance values in
our data to figure out what is going on.</p>
<pre><code># Plot range of reflectance values as a histogram to view range

# and distribution of values.

hist(b9,breaks=40,col=&quot;darkmagenta&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main//tutorials/R/AOP/Hyperspectral/Work-With-Hyperspectral-Data-In-R/rfigs/hist-data-1.png" alt="Histogram of reflectance values for band 9. The x-axis represents the reflectance values and ranges from 0 to 8000. The frequency of these values is on the y-axis. The histogram shows reflectance values are skewed to the right, where the majority of the values lie between 0 and 1000. We can conclude that reflectance values are not equally distributed across the range of reflectance values, resulting in a washed out image." /></p>
<pre><code># View values between 0 and 5000

hist(b9,breaks=40,col=&quot;darkmagenta&quot;,xlim = c(0, 5000))
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main//tutorials/R/AOP/Hyperspectral/Work-With-Hyperspectral-Data-In-R/rfigs/hist-data-2.png" alt="Histogram of reflectance values between 0 and 5000 for band 9. Reflectance values are on the x-axis, and the frequency is on the y-axis. The x-axis limit has been set 5000 in order to better visualize the distribution of reflectance values. We can confirm that the majority of the values are indeed within the 0 to 4000 range." /></p>
<pre><code># View higher values

hist(b9, breaks=40,col=&quot;darkmagenta&quot;,xlim = c(5000, 15000),ylim=c(0,100))
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main//tutorials/R/AOP/Hyperspectral/Work-With-Hyperspectral-Data-In-R/rfigs/hist-data-3.png" alt="Histogram of reflectance values between 5000 and 15000 for band 9. Reflectance values are on the x-axis, and the frequency is on the y-axis. Plot shows that a very few number of pixels have reflectance values larger than 5,000. These values are skewing how the image is being rendered and heavily impacting the way the image is drawn on our monitor." /></p>
<p>As you’re examining the histograms above, keep in mind that reflectance values
range between 0-1. The <strong>data scale factor</strong> in the metadata tells us to divide
all reflectance values by 10,000. Thus, a value of 5,000 equates to a reflectance
value of 0.50. Storing data as integers (without decimal places) compared to
floating points (with decimal places) creates a smaller file. You will see this
done often when working with remote sensing data.</p>
<p>Notice in the data that there are some larger reflectance values (&gt;5,000) that
represent a smaller number of pixels. These pixels are skewing how the image
renders.</p>
<h3 id="data-ignore-value">Data Ignore Value</h3>
<p>Image data in raster
format will often contain a data ignore value and a scale factor. The data ignore
value represents pixels where there are no data. Among other causes, no data
values may be attributed to the sensor not collecting data in that area of the
image or to processing results which yield null values.</p>
<p>Remember that the metadata for the <code>Reflectance</code> dataset designated -9999 as
<code>data ignore value</code>. Thus, let’s set all pixels with a value == -9999 to <code>NA</code>
(no value). If we do this, R won’t try to render these pixels.</p>
<pre><code># there is a no data value in our raster - let's define it

myNoDataValue &lt;- as.numeric(reflInfo$Data_Ignore_Value)

myNoDataValue

## [1] -9999

# set all values equal to -9999 to NA

b9[b9 == myNoDataValue] &lt;- NA



# plot the image now

image(b9)
</code></pre>

Image data in raster format will often contain no data values, which may be attributed to the sensor not collecting data in that area of the image or to processing results which yield null values. Reflectance datasets designate -9999 as data ignore values. As such, we will reassign -9999 values to NA so R won’t try to render these pixels." /></p>
<h3 id="reflectance-values-and-image-stretch">Reflectance Values and Image Stretch</h3>
<p>Our image still looks dark because R is trying to render all reflectance values
between 0 and 14999 as if they were distributed equally in the histogram. However
we know they are not distributed equally. There are many more values between
0-5000 then there are values &gt;5000.</p>
<p>Images have a distribution of reflectance values. A typical image viewing program
will render the values by distributing the entire range of reflectance values<br />
across a range of “shades” that the monitor can render - between 0 and 255.
However, often the distribution of reflectance values is not linear. For example,
in the case of our data, most of the reflectance values fall between 0 and 0.5.
Yet there are a few values &gt;0.8 that are heavily impacting the way the image is
drawn on our monitor. Imaging processing programs like ENVI, QGIS and ArcGIS (and
even Adobe Photoshop) allow you to adjust the stretch of the image. This is similar
to adjusting the contrast and brightness in Photoshop.</p>
<p>The proper way to adjust our data would be
what’s called an <code>image stretch</code>. We will learn how to stretch our image data,
later. For now, let’s plot the values as the log function on the pixel
reflectance values to factor out those larger values.</p>
<pre><code>image(log(b9))
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main//tutorials/R/AOP/Hyperspectral/Work-With-Hyperspectral-Data-In-R/rfigs/plot-log-1.png" alt="Plot of log transformed reflectance values for the previous b9 image. Applying the log to the image increases the contrast making it look more like an image by factoring out those larger values. While an improvement, the image is still far from great. The proper way to adjust an image is by doing whats called an image stretch." /></p>
<p>The log applied to our image increases the contrast making it look more like an
image. However, look at the images below. The top one is an RGB image as the
image should look. The bottom one is our log-adjusted image. Notice a difference?</p>

The log transformed image appears flipped because when R reads in the dataset, it reads them as: Columns x Bands x Rows, as opposed to the RGB image on the left which has dimensions as Bands x Rows x Columns.">

<h3 id="transpose-image">Transpose Image</h3>
<p>Notice that there are three data dimensions for this file: Bands x Rows x
Columns. However, when R reads in the dataset, it reads them as: Columns x
Bands x Rows. The data are flipped. We can quickly transpose the data to correct
for this using the <code>t</code> or <code>transpose</code> command in R.</p>
<p>The orientation is rotated in our log adjusted image. This is because R reads
in matrices starting from the upper left hand corner. Whereas, most rasters
read pixels starting from the lower left hand corner. In the next section, we
will deal with this issue by creating a proper georeferenced (spatially located)
raster in R. The raster format will read in pixels following the same methods
as other GIS and imaging processing software like QGIS and ENVI do.</p>
<pre><code># We need to transpose x and y values in order for our 

# final image to plot properly

The orientation of the image is rotated in our log transformed image, because R reads in the matrices starting from the upper left hand corner." /></p>
<h2 id="create-a-georeferenced-raster">Create a Georeferenced Raster</h2>
<p>Next, we will create a proper raster using the <code>b9</code> matrix. The raster
format will allow us to define and manage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image stretch</li>
<li>Coordinate reference system &amp; spatial reference</li>
<li>Resolution</li>
<li>and other raster attributes…</li>
</ul>
<p>It will also account for the orientation issue discussed above.</p>
<p>To create a raster in R, we need a few pieces of information, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The coordinate reference system (CRS)</li>
<li>The spatial extent of the image</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="define-raster-crs">Define Raster CRS</h3>
<p>First, we need to define the Coordinate reference system (CRS) of the raster.
To do that, we can first grab the EPSG code from the HDF5 attributes, and covert the
EPSG to a CRS string. Then we can assign that CRS to the raster object.</p>
<pre><code># Extract the EPSG from the h5 dataset

myEPSG &lt;- h5read(f, &quot;/SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Coordinate_System/EPSG Code&quot;)



# convert the EPSG code to a CRS string

myCRS &lt;- crs(paste0(&quot;+init=epsg:&quot;,myEPSG))



# define final raster with projection info 

# note that capitalization will throw errors on a MAC.

# if UTM is all caps it might cause an error!

b9r &lt;- rast(b9, 
        crs=myCRS)



# view the raster attributes

b9r

## class       : SpatRaster 
## dimensions  : 500, 500, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)
## resolution  : 1, 1  (x, y)
## extent      : 0, 500, 0, 500  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
## coord. ref. : WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N 
## source(s)   : memory
## name        : lyr.1 
## min value   :     0 
## max value   :  9210

# let's have a look at our properly oriented raster. Take note of the 

# coordinates on the x and y axis.



image(log(b9r), 
      xlab = &quot;UTM Easting&quot;, 
      ylab = &quot;UTM Northing&quot;,
      main = &quot;Properly Oriented Raster&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main//tutorials/R/AOP/Hyperspectral/Work-With-Hyperspectral-Data-In-R/rfigs/define-CRS-1.png" alt="Plot of the properly oriented raster image of the band 9 data. In order to orient the image correctly, the coordinate reference system was defined and assigned to the raster object. X-axis represents the UTM Easting values, and the Y-axis represents the Northing values." /></p>
<p>Next we define the extents of our raster. The extents will be used to calculate
the raster’s resolution. Fortunately, the spatial extent is provided in the
HDF5 file “Reflectance_Data” group attributes that we saved before as <code>reflInfo</code>.</p>
<pre><code># Grab the UTM coordinates of the spatial extent

xMin &lt;- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[1]

xMax &lt;- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[2]

yMin &lt;- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[3]

yMax &lt;- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[4]



# define the extent (left, right, top, bottom)

rasExt &lt;- ext(xMin,xMax,yMin,yMax)

rasExt

## SpatExtent : 257500, 258000, 4112500, 4113000 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)

# assign the spatial extent to the raster

ext(b9r) &lt;- rasExt



# look at raster attributes

b9r

<p>We can adjust the colors of our raster too if we want.</p>

      xlab = &quot;UTM Easting&quot;,

<p>We’ve now created a raster from band 9 reflectance data. We can export the data
as a raster, using the <code>writeRaster</code> command.</p>
<pre><code># write out the raster as a geotiff

writeRaster(b9r,

            file=paste0(wd,&quot;band9.tif&quot;),

            overwrite=TRUE)



# It's always good practice to close the H5 connection before moving on!

# close the H5 file

<li>
<p>Create rasters using other bands in the dataset.</p>
