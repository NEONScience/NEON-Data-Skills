## Introduction
In this second live coding section of the workshop, we will explore how to find and download NEON biodiversity data using the ecocomDP package for R, which is under development by the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) in collaboration with NEON staff.

#### What is ecocomDP?
ecocomDP is both the name of an R package and a data model. 
 
EDI describes the ecocomDP data model as "A dataset design pattern for ecological community data to facilitate synthesis and reuse". 
 
See the ecocomDP github repo here:
<a href="https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP ">https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP</a>.

The motivation is for both NEON biodiversity data products and EDI data packages, including data from the US Long Term Ecological Research Network and Macrosystems Biology projects, to be discoverable through a single data search tool, and to be delivered in a standard format. Our objective here is to demonstrate how the workflow will work with NEON biodiversity data packages. 

This tutorial was prepared for the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/get-involved/events/sfs-2021-neon-aquatic-biodiversity-workshop">Society for Freshwater Science 2021 NEON Aquatic Biodiversity Workshop</a>.

## Load Libraries and Prepare Workspace
First, we will load all necessary libraries into our R environment. If you have not already installed these libraries, please see the 'R Packages to Install' section above. 

There are also two optional sections in this code chunk: clearing your environment, and loading your NEON API token. Clearing out your environment will erase _all_ of the variables and data that are currently loaded in your R session. This is a good practice for many reasons, but only do this if you are completely sure that you won't be losing any important information! Secondly, your NEON API token will allow you increased download speeds, and helps NEON __anonymously__ track data usage statistics, which helps us optimize our data delivery platforms, and informs our monthly and annual reporting to our funding agency, the National Science Foundation. Please consider signing up for a NEON data user account, and using your token <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/neon-api-tokens-tutorial">as described in this tutorial here</a>.

```{r load libraries, eval=F, comment=NA}

# clean out workspace

#rm(list = ls()) # OPTIONAL - clear out your environment
#gc()            # Uncomment these lines if desired

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(neonUtilities)
library(vegan)
library(ecocomDP)

# source .r file with my NEON_TOKEN
# source("my_neon_token.R") # OPTIONAL - load NEON token
# See: https://www.neonscience.org/neon-api-tokens-tutorial

```

```{r load libraries-hidden, include = FALSE, purl = FALSE}

## This code chunk is hidden and will only be ran 
# during the knitting process

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(neonUtilities)
library(vegan)
library(ecocomDP)

```

## Download Macroinvertibrate Data
In this first step, we show how to search the ecocomDP database for macroinvertebrate data including those from LTER and NEON sites (and others).
```{r download-macroinvert, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

# search for invertebrate data products
my_search_result <- 
    ecocomDP::search_data(text = "invertebrate")
View(my_search_result)

# pull data for the NEON aquatic "Macroinvertebrate
# collection"
my_data <- ecocomDP::read_data(
  id = "neon.ecocomdp.20120.001.001",
  site = "ARIK",
  startdate = "2017-06",
  enddate = "2020-03",
  # token = NEON_TOKEN, #Uncomment to use your token
  check.size = FALSE)

```

Now that we have downloaded the data, let's take a look at tht `ecocomDP` data object structure:

```{r view-ecocomDP-str}

# examine the structure of the data object that is returned
my_data %>% names()
my_data$id

# short list of package summary data
my_data$metadata$data_package_info

# validation issues? None if returns an empty list
my_data$validation_issues

# examine the tables
my_data$tables %>% names()
my_data$tables$taxon %>% head()
my_data$tables$observation %>% head()

```


## Search ecocomDP

We can even search for terms in the ecocomDP database using regular expressions:

```{r search-ecocomDP}

# search for data sets with periphyton or algae
# regex works!
my_search_result <- ecocomDP::search_data(text = "periphyt|algae")
View(my_search_result)

```

Let's download the data for the NEON "Periphyton, seston, and phytoplankton collection" from "ARIK" and view its structure:

```{r download-algae-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

# pull data for the NEON "Periphyton, seston, and phytoplankton collection" 
# data product
my_data <- 
    ecocomDP::read_data(
      id = "neon.ecocomdp.20166.001.001", 
      site = "ARIK",
      startdate = "2017-06",
      enddate = "2020-03",
      # token = NEON_TOKEN, #Uncomment to use your token
      check.size = FALSE)

```

```{r explore-data-structure}
# Explore the structure of the returned data object
my_data %>% names()
my_data %>% names()
my_data$metadata$data_package_info
my_data$validation_issues
my_data$tables %>% names()

my_data$tables$location
my_data$tables$taxon %>% head()
my_data$tables$observation %>% head()



```

## Algae Data Flattening and Cleaning

While the ecocomDP data package takes care of some data cleaning and formatting, it is best to join all the tables and flatten the dataset and do some basic checks before proceeding with plotting and analyses:

```{r flattening-and-cleaning, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# flatten the ecocomDP data tables into one flat table
my_data_flat <- my_data$tables %>% ecocomDP::flatten_data()

# This data product has algal densities reported for both
# lakes and streams, so densities could be standardized
# either to volume collected or area sampled. 

# Verify that only benthic algae standardized to area 
# are returned in this data pull:
my_data_flat$unit %>%
    unique()



# filter the data to only records standardized to area
# sampled
my_data_benthic <- my_data_flat %>%
  dplyr::filter(
    !variable_name %in% c("valves","cells"),
    unit == "cells/cm2")

# Note that for this data product
# neon_sample_id = event_id
# event_id is the grouping variable for the observation 
# table in the ecocomDP data model



# Check for multiple taxon counts per taxon_id by 
# event_id. 
my_data_benthic %>% 
  group_by(event_id, taxon_id) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = length(event_id)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(n_obs > 1)



# Per instructions from the lab, these 
# counts should be summed.
my_data_summed <- my_data_benthic %>%
  group_by(event_id,taxon_id) %>%
  summarize(value = sum(value, na.rm = FALSE))

my_data_cleaned <- my_data_benthic %>%
  dplyr::select(
    event_id, location_id, datetime,
    taxon_id, taxon_rank, taxon_name) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  right_join(my_data_summed)



# check for duplicate records, there should not 
# be any at this point.
my_data_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(event_id, taxon_id) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = length(event_id)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(n_obs > 1)

```

We can also make a quick plot to see which taxon rank (i.e., what level of taxonomic specificity was achieved by the expert taxonomist) is most common:

```{r plot-taxon-rank, fig.cap= "Bar plot showing the frequency of each taxonomic rank observed in algae count data from the Arikaree River site."}

# which taxon rank is most common
my_data_cleaned %>%
  ggplot(aes(taxon_rank)) +
  geom_bar()

```

## Species Accumulation Curve
Next, we will plot the species accumulation curve for these samples. To do so, we will first need to convert the density data from m2 to cm2, and make the data 'wide':

```{r SAC-1, fig.cap= "Species accumalation plot for 11 sampling events. Confidence intervals are based on random permutations of observed samples."}

# convert densities from per m2 to per cm2
my_data_long <- my_data_cleaned %>%
  filter(taxon_rank == "species") %>%
  select(event_id, taxon_id, value)

# make data wide
my_data_wide <- my_data_long %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = taxon_id, 
              values_from = value,
              values_fill = list(value = 0)) %>%
  tibble::column_to_rownames("event_id")
  
# Calculate and plot species accumulcation curve for the 11 sampling events
# The CIs are based on random permutations of observed samples
alg_spec_accum_result <- my_data_wide %>% vegan::specaccum(., "random")
plot(alg_spec_accum_result)

```

## Compare Observed and Simulated species accumulation curves

```{r compare-obs-sim-SAC}

# Extract the resampling data used in the above algorithm
spec_resamp_data <- data.frame(
  data_set = "observed", 
  sampling_effort = rep(1:nrow(alg_spec_accum_result$perm), 
                        each = ncol(alg_spec_accum_result$perm)),
  richness = c(t(alg_spec_accum_result$perm)))


# Fit species accumulation model
spec_accum_mod_1 <- my_data_wide %>% vegan::fitspecaccum(model = "arrh")


# create a "predicted" data set from the model to extrapolate out 
# beyond the number of samples collected
sim_spec_data <- data.frame()
for(i in 1:100){
  d_tmp <- data.frame(
    data_set = "predicted",
    sampling_effort = i,
    richness = predict(spec_accum_mod_1, newdata = i))
  
  sim_spec_data <- sim_spec_data %>%
    bind_rows(d_tmp)
}


# plot the "observed" and "simulated" curves with 95% CIs
data_plot <- spec_resamp_data %>% bind_rows(sim_spec_data) 

data_plot %>%
  ggplot(aes(sampling_effort, richness, 
             color = as.factor(data_set),
             fill = as.factor(data_set),
             linetype = as.factor(data_set))) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = median_hilow, fun.args = list(conf.int = .95), 
               geom = "ribbon", alpha = 0.25) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = median_hilow, geom = "line", 
               size = 1) 
    
```
