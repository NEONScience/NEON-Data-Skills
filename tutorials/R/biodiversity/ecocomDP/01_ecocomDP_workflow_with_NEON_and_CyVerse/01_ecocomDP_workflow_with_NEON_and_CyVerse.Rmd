## Learning Objectives 
After completing this tutorial you will be able to: 

* (Optional) Run an RStudio session with `ecocomDP` pre-installed on the VICE cloud using the CyVerse Discovery Environment.
* Use the ecocomDP package to download NEON algae and benthic macroinvertebrate biodiversity data.
* Explore NEON biodiversity datasets with `ecocomDP` plotting functions.


## Things You’ll Need To Complete This Tutorial

## _Option 1: RStudio on the VICE cloud_

### Creating a CyVerse Account

To create a CyVerse account, navigate to [user.cyverse.org](https://user.cyverse.org/) and click "Sign Up". You will be prompted to fill in your name, a username, and an email. It is **highly recommended** that you use a `.edu`, `.org`, or `.gov` email address if you have one. Cloud computing platforms are a prime target for cryptocurrency miners, and using an institutional email address makes it easier to verify that you *aren't* one.

You will be prompted to fill out a few more pieces of information about yourself and what you intend to use CyVerse for. Once you have completed the registration process, you will have a CyVerse account and can proceed to the next step.

### Requesting VICE Access

Next, you will have to request access to the Visual Interactive Computing Environment (VICE), which is a platform for running interactive applications, like RStudio or JupyterLab, on the cloud. VICE access requires a one-time approval, due to the cryptocurrency miner issue mentioned above.

You can navigate to [user.cyverse.org/services](https://user.cyverse.org/services) to find services you have access to. You can locate **DE-VICE** and click "Request Access", where you will be prompted to provide information about why you are using VICE. It may take up to a day for VICE access to be approved, so it is worth doing this step ahead of time.

**NOTE**: if you are participating in a workshop that is registered through CyVerse, you may have pre-approved for VICE access. If this is the case, **DE-VICE** will be listed under "My Services", and instead of seeing "Request Access", you will see "Launch". 

Once **DE-VICE** appears under "My Services" in the User Portal, with a "Launch" button, that means you have been approved for VICE access, and you can proceed to the next step.

### Launching RStudio with the `ecocomDP` package

We will be using an RStudio application running on the VICE cloud. It already has several R packages installed for this tutorial

Use this URL to access the application: [https://de.cyverse.org/apps/de/61b7335a-52d2-11ec-ba89-008cfa5ae621](https://de.cyverse.org/apps/de/61b7335a-52d2-11ec-ba89-008cfa5ae621).  
Click on the app name ("Rocker Verse + ecocomDP") to proceed.  
**NOTE**: You may be prompted to log in using your CyVerse credentials.

Next, you will see a screen where you can name your analysis and change other parameters. We will just use the default options, so you can hit the **Next** button to move through each page until you reach the last page. Now you can click **Launch Analysis** to launch the RStudio application.

You will be taken to a page that says your analysis has been submitted. You can now go to the lefthand navigation bar and click on the **Analyses** item to go to the Analyses page. From here you can see all your currently running analyses, as well as any completed analyses. Your *Rocker Verse + ecocomDP* analysis should have a Status of either "Submitted" or "Running". It may take a few minutes for the analysis to launch. On the righthand side of the screen, you should see a **Launch Analysis** icon that looks like a square with an arrow coming out of it. Click on it to open your analysis in a new tab.

You will either be brought to a loading page or directly to an RStudio session. If you are on the loading page, just wait a few minutes, and RStudio should appear.

Once RStudio is open, you should be able to begin the rest of the tutorial.

**NOTE**: to get more information on using any of the CyVerse platforms, including VICE, you can check out the [CyVerse Learning Center](https://learning.cyverse.org/).


## _Option 2: Run R locally on your machine_
### The R Programming Language
You will need a current version of R to complete this tutorial. We also recommend 
the RStudio IDE to work with R. 

### R Packages to Install
Prior to starting the tutorial, ensure that the following packages are installed. 

* **tidyverse:** `install.packages("tidyverse")`
* **neonUtilities:** `install.packages("neonUtilities")`
* **ecocomDP:** `install.packages("ecocomDP")`

## Introduction
In this code-along tutorial, we will explore how to find and download NEON biodiversity data using the ecocomDP package for R, which has been developed by the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) in collaboration with NEON staff.

#### What is ecocomDP?
"ecocomDP" is both the name of an R package and a data model. 
 
EDI describes the ecocomDP data model as "A dataset design pattern for ecological community data to facilitate synthesis and reuse". 
 
See the ecocomDP GitHub repo here:
<a href="https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP ">https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP</a>.

</figure>

The motivation is for both NEON biodiversity data products and EDI data packages, including data from the US Long Term Ecological Research Network and Macrosystems Biology projects, to be discoverable through a single data search tool, and to be delivered in a standard format. Our objective here is to demonstrate how the workflow will work with NEON biodiversity data packages. 

## Load Libraries and Prepare Workspace
First, we will load all necessary libraries into our R environment. If you are not using the RStudio VICE app with the packages pre-installed and you have not already installed these libraries, please see the 'R Packages to Install' section above. 

There are also two optional sections in this code chunk: clearing your environment, and loading your NEON API token. Clearing out your environment will erase _all_ of the variables and data that are currently loaded in your R session. This is a good practice for many reasons, but only do this if you are completely sure that you won't be losing any important information! Secondly, your NEON API token will allow you increased download speeds, and helps NEON __anonymously__ track data usage statistics, which helps us optimize our data delivery platforms, and informs our monthly and annual reporting to our funding agency, the National Science Foundation. Please consider signing up for a NEON data user account, and using your token <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/neon-api-tokens-tutorial">as described in this tutorial here</a>.

```{r load libraries, eval=F, comment=NA}

# clean out workspace

#rm(list = ls()) # OPTIONAL - clear out your environment
#gc()            # Uncomment these lines if desired

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(neonUtilities)
library(ecocomDP)

# source .r file with my NEON_TOKEN
# source("my_neon_token.R") # OPTIONAL - load NEON token
# See: https://www.neonscience.org/neon-api-tokens-tutorial

```


```{r load libraries-hidden, include = FALSE, purl = FALSE}

## This code chunk is hidden and will only be ran 
# during the knitting process

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(neonUtilities)
library(ecocomDP)

```


## Download Macroinvertibrate Data
In this first step, we show how to search the ecocomDP database for macroinvertebrate data including those from LTER and NEON sites (and others).

```{r download-macroinvert, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

# search for invertebrate data products
my_search_result <- ecocomDP::search_data(text = "invertebrate")
View(my_search_result)

# pull data for the NEON aquatic "Macroinvertebrate
# collection" from ARIK collected during 2017 and 2018
my_data <- ecocomDP::read_data(
  id = "neon.ecocomdp.20120.001.001",
  site = "ARIK",
  startdate = "2017-01",
  enddate = "2018-12",
  # token = NEON_TOKEN, #Uncomment to use your token
  check.size = FALSE)

```


Now that we have downloaded the data, let's take a look at tht `ecocomDP` data object structure:

```{r view-ecocomDP-str}

# examine the structure of the data object that is returned
my_data %>% names()

# the data package id
my_data$id

# short list of package summary data
my_data$metadata$data_package_info

# validation issues? None if returns an empty list
my_data$validation_issues

# examine the tables
my_data$tables %>% names()
my_data$tables$taxon %>% head()
my_data$tables$observation %>% head()

```


## Basic Data Visualization

The `ecocomDP` package offers some useful data visualization tools.

```{r macroinvert-datavis-space-time, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Sampling events in space and time represented in the downloaded data set for benthic macroinvertebrate counts from the Arikaree River site."}

# Explore the spatial and temporal coverage 
# of the dataset
my_data %>% ecocomDP::plot_sample_space_time()

```

```{r macroinvert-datavis-ranks, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Frequencies of different taxonomic ranks in benthic macroinvertebrate counts from the Arikaree River site."}

# Explore the taxonomic resolution in the dataset. 
# What is the most common taxonomic resolution (rank) 
# for macroinvertebrate identifications in this dataset?
my_data %>% ecocomDP::plot_taxa_rank()

```




## Search `ecocomDP`

Additionally, we can search for terms in the ecocomDP database using regular expressions:

```{r search-ecocomDP}

# search for data sets with periphyton or algae
# regex works!
my_search_result <- ecocomDP::search_data(text = "periphyt|algae")
View(my_search_result)

```


Let's download data for the NEON "Periphyton, seston, and phytoplankton collection" from "ARIK" and "COMO" and view their structure:

```{r download-algae-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

# pull data for the NEON "Periphyton, seston, and phytoplankton collection" 
# data product (expect the download to take 1-2 mins)
my_data <- ecocomDP::read_data(
  id = "neon.ecocomdp.20166.001.001", 
  site = c("ARIK","COMO"),
  startdate = "2017-01",
  enddate = "2020-12",
  # token = NEON_TOKEN, #Uncomment to use your token
  check.size = FALSE)

```


```{r explore-algae-data-structure}
# Explore the structure of the returned data object
my_data %>% names()
my_data$id
my_data$metadata$data_package_info
my_data$validation_issues
my_data$tables %>% names()

my_data$tables$location
my_data$tables$taxon %>% head()
my_data$tables$observation %>% head()

```


## Algae Data Flattening and Cleaning

While the ecocomDP data package takes care of some data cleaning and formatting, it is best to join all the tables and flatten the dataset and do some basic checks before proceeding with plotting and analyses:

```{r flattening-and-cleaning, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# flatten the ecocomDP data tables into one flat table
my_data_flat <- my_data %>% ecocomDP::flatten_data()

# This data product has algal densities reported for both
# lakes and streams, so densities could be standardized
# either to volume collected or area sampled. 

# Verify that only benthic algae standardized to area 
# are returned in this data pull:
my_data_flat$unit %>%
    unique()



# filter the data to only records standardized to area
# sampled
my_data_benthic <- my_data_flat %>%
  dplyr::filter(unit == "cells/cm2")
```


## Explore Benthic Algae Data with `ecocomDP` Plotting Functions

```{r algae-data-vis-space-time, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Sampling events in space in time represented in the downloaded data set for algae."}

# Note that you can send flattened data 
# to the ecocomDP plotting functions
my_data_benthic %>% ecocomDP::plot_sample_space_time()

```



```{r algae-data-vis-richness-time, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Benthic algal richness by year at ARIK and COMO"}

# Note that you can also send flattened data 
# to the ecocomDP plotting functions
my_data_benthic %>% ecocomDP::plot_taxa_diversity(time_window_size = "year")

```
