<h2>Background Information About NEON Air Temperature Data</h2>

<p>Air temperature is continuously monitored by NEON by two methods. At terrestrial 
sites temperature at the top of the tower is derived from a triple 
redundant aspirated air temperature sensor. This is provided as NEON data 
product <strong>DP1.00003.001</strong>. Single Aspirated Air Temperature sensors (SAAT) are 
deployed to develop temperature profiles at multiple levels on the tower at NEON 
terrestrial sites and on the meteorological stations at NEON aquatic sites. This 
is provided as NEON data product <strong>DP1.00002.001</strong>.</p>

<p>When designing a research project using this data, consult the 
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00002.001" target="_blank">Data Product Details Page</a> 
for more detailed documentation. </p>

<h3>Single-aspirated Air Temperature</h3>

<p>Air temperature profiles are ascertained by deploying SAATs at various heights 
on NEON tower infrastructure. Air temperature at aquatic sites is measured 
using a single SAAT at a standard height of 3m above ground level. Air temperature 
for this data product is provided as one- and thirty-minute averages of 1 Hz 
observations. Temperature observations are made using platinum resistance 
thermometers, which are housed in a fan aspirated shield to reduce radiative 
heating. The temperature is measured in Ohms and subsequently converted to degrees 
Celsius during data processing. Details on the conversion can be found in the 
associated Algorithm Theoretic Basis Document (ATBD; see Product Details page 
linked above).</p>

<h3>Available Data Tables</h3>

<p>The SAAT data product contains two data tables for each site and month selected, 
consisting of the 1-minute and 30-minute averaging intervals. In addition, there 
are several metadata files that provide additional useful information.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>readme</strong> with information on the data product and the download</li>
<li><strong>variables</strong> file that defines the terms, data types, and units</li>
<li><strong>EML</strong> file with machine readable metadata in standardized Ecological Metadata Language </li>
</ul>

<h2>Access NEON Data</h2>

<p>There are several ways to access NEON data, directly from the NEON data portal, 
access through a data partner (select data products only), writing code to 
directly pull data from the NEON API, or, as we&#39;ll do here, using the neonUtilities
package which is a wrapper for the API to make working with the data easier. </p>

<h3>Downloading from the Data Portal</h3>

<p>If you prefer to download data from the data portal, please 
review the <em>Getting started</em> and <em>Stack the downloaded data</em> sections of the
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/download-explore-neon-data" target="_blank"> <em>Download and Explore NEON Data</em> tutorial</a>. 
This will get you to the point where you can download data from sites or dates
of interest and resume this tutorial. </p>

<h3>Downloading Data Using neonUtilities</h3>

<p>First, we need to set up our environment with the packages needed for this tutorial. </p>

<pre><code># Install needed package (only uncomment &amp; run if not already installed)

#install.packages(&quot;neonUtilities&quot;)

#install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)

#install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;)

#install.packages(&quot;tidyr&quot;)





# Load required libraries

library(neonUtilities)  # for accessing NEON data

library(ggplot2)  # for plotting

library(dplyr)  # for data munging

library(tidyr)  # for data munging



# set working directory

# this step is optional, only needed if you plan to save the 

# data files at the end of the tutorial

wd &lt;- &quot;~/data&quot; # enter your working directory here

setwd(wd)
</code></pre>

<p>This tutorial is part of series working with discrete plant phenology data and 
(nearly) continuous temperature data. Our overall &ldquo;research&rdquo; question is to see if 
there is any correlation between plant phenology and temperature. 
Therefore, we will want to work with data that 
align with the plant phenology data that we worked with in the first tutorial. 
If you are only interested in working with the temperature data, you do not need
to complete the previous tutorial. </p>

<p>Our data of interest will be the temperature data from 2018 from NEON&#39;s 
Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) field site located in Virginia
near the northern terminus of the Blue Ridge Mountains. </p>

<p>NEON single aspirated air temperature data is available in two averaging intervals, 
1 minute and 30 minute intervals. Which data you want to work with is going to 
depend on your research questions. Here, we&#39;re going to only download and work 
with the 30 minute interval data as we&#39;re primarily interest in longer term (daily, 
weekly, annual) patterns. </p>

<p>This will download 7.7 MB of data. <code>check.size</code> is set to false (<code>F</code>) to improve flow 
of the script but is always a good idea to view the size with true (<code>T</code>) before 
downloading a new dataset. </p>

<pre><code># download data of interest - Single Aspirated Air Temperature

saat &lt;- loadByProduct(dpID=&quot;DP1.00002.001&quot;, site=&quot;SCBI&quot;, 
                      startdate=&quot;2018-01&quot;, enddate=&quot;2018-12&quot;, 
                      package=&quot;basic&quot;, timeIndex=&quot;30&quot;,
                      check.size = F)
</code></pre>

<h2>Explore Temperature Data</h2>

<p>Now that you have the data, let&#39;s take a look at the structure and understand 
what&#39;s in the data. The data (<code>saat</code>) come in as a large list of four items. </p>

<pre><code>View(saat)
</code></pre>

<p>So what exactly are these five files and why would you want to use them? </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>data file(s)</strong>: There will always be one or more dataframes that include the 
primary data of the data product you downloaded. Since we downloaded only the 30 
minute averaged data we only have one data table <code>SAAT_30min</code>.</li>
<li><strong>readme_xxxxx</strong>: The readme file, with the corresponding 5 digits from the data
product number, provides you with important information relevant to the data 
product and the specific instance of downloading the data.</li>
<li><strong>sensor_positions_xxxxx</strong>: This table contains the spatial coordinates 
of each sensor, relative to a reference location. </li>
<li><strong>variables_xxxxx</strong>: This table contains all the variables found in the associated
data table(s). This includes full definitions, units, and rounding. </li>
<li><strong>issueLog_xxxxx</strong>: This table contains records of any known issues with the 
data product, such as sensor malfunctions. </li>
<li><strong>scienceReviewFlags_xxxxx</strong>: This table may or may not be present. It contains 
descriptions of adverse events that led to manual flagging of the data, and is 
usually more detailed than the issue log. It only contains records relevant to 
the sites and dates of data downloaded.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we want to work with the individual files, let&#39;s make the elements of the 
list into independent objects. </p>

<pre><code>list2env(saat, .GlobalEnv)

## &lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now let&#39;s take a look at the data table.</p>

<pre><code>str(SAAT_30min)

## &#39;data.frame&#39;:    87600 obs. of  16 variables:

<h2>Quality Flags</h2>

<p>The sensor data undergo a variety of automated quality assurance and quality control 
checks. You can read about them in detail in the <a href="https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00002.001" target="_blank">Quality Flags and Quality Metrics ATBD</a>, in the Documentation section of the product details page.
The expanded data package 
includes all of these quality flags, which can allow you to decide if not passing
one of the checks will significantly hamper your research and if you should 
therefore remove the data from your analysis. Here, we&#39;re using the
basic data package, which only includes the final quality flag (<code>finalQF</code>), 
which is aggregated from the full set of quality flags. </p>

<p>A pass of the check is <strong>0</strong>, while a fail is <strong>1</strong>. Let&#39;s see what percentage 
of the data we downloaded passed the quality checks.</p>

<pre><code>sum(SAAT_30min$finalQF==1)/nrow(SAAT_30min)

## [1] 0.2340297
</code></pre>

<p>What should we do with the 23% of the data that are flagged? 
This may depend on why it is flagged and what questions you are asking, 
and the expanded data package would be useful for determining this.  </p>

<p>For now, for demonstration purposes, we&#39;ll keep the flagged data.  </p>

<p>What about null (<code>NA</code>) data? </p>

<pre><code>sum(is.na(SAAT_30min$tempSingleMean))/nrow(SAAT_30min)

## [1] 0.2239269

mean(SAAT_30min$tempSingleMean)

## [1] NA
</code></pre>

<p>22% of the mean temperature values are <code>NA</code>. Note that this is not 
additive with the flagged data! Empty data records are flagged, so this 
indicates nearly all of the flagged data in our download are empty records.</p>

<p>Why was there no output from the calculation of mean temperature? </p>

<p>The R programming language, by default, won&#39;t calculate a mean (and many other 
summary statistics) in data that contain <code>NA</code> values. We could override this 
using the input parameter <code>na.rm=TRUE</code> in the <code>mean()</code> function, or just 
remove the empty values from our analysis.</p>

<pre><code># create new dataframe without NAs

SAAT_30min_noNA &lt;- SAAT_30min %&gt;%
    drop_na(tempSingleMean)  # tidyr function



# alternate base R

# SAAT_30min_noNA &lt;- SAAT_30min[!is.na(SAAT_30min$tempSingleMean),]



# did it work?

sum(is.na(SAAT_30min_noNA$tempSingleMean))

## [1] 0
</code></pre>

<h2>Scatterplots with ggplot</h2>

<p>We can use ggplot to create scatter plots. Which data should we plot, as we have 
several options? </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>tempSingleMean</strong>: the mean temperature for the interval</li>
<li><strong>tempSingleMinimum</strong>: the minimum temperature during the interval</li>
<li><strong>tempSingleMaximum</strong>: the maximum temperature for the interval</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on exactly what question you are asking you may prefer to use one over
the other. For many applications, the <strong>mean temperature</strong> of the 1- or 30-minute
interval will provide the best representation of the data. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s plot it. (This is a plot of a large amount of data. It can take 1-2 mins 
to process. It is not essential for completing the next steps if this takes too 
much of your computer memory.)</p>

<pre><code># plot temp data

tempPlot &lt;- ggplot(SAAT_30min, aes(startDateTime, tempSingleMean)) +
    geom_point(size=0.3) +
    ggtitle(&quot;Single Aspirated Air Temperature&quot;) +
    xlab(&quot;Date&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Temp (C)&quot;) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face=&quot;bold&quot;, size = 20)) +
    theme(text = element_text(size=18))



tempPlot

## Warning: Removed 19616 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/biodiversity/neon-phenology-temp/02-drivers-pheno-change-temp/rfigs/plot-temp-1.png" alt="Scatter plot of mean temperatures for the year 2018 at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI). Plotted data shows erroneous sensor readings occured during late April/May 2018."/></p>

<p>What patterns can you see in the data? </p>

<p>Something odd seems to have happened in late April/May 2018. Since it is unlikely 
Virginia experienced -50C during this time, these are probably erroneous sensor 
readings and why we should probably remove data that are flagged with those quality
flags. </p>

<p>Right now we are also looking at all the data points in the dataset. However, we may
want to view or aggregate the data differently:  </p>

<ul>
<li>aggregated data: min, mean, or max over a some duration</li>
<li>the number of days since a freezing temperatures</li>
<li>or some other segregation of the data.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Given that in the previous tutorial, 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/neon-plant-pheno-data-r" target="_blank"> <em>Work With NEON&#39;s Plant Phenology Data</em></a>, 
we were working with phenology data collected on a daily scale let&#39;s aggregate
to that level.</p>

<p>To make this plot better, lets do two things</p>

<p>1) Remove flagged data
2) Aggregate to a daily mean. </p>

<h3>Subset to remove quality flagged data</h3>

<p>We already removed the empty records. Now we&#39;ll 
subset the data to remove the remaining flagged data. </p>

<pre><code># subset and add C to name for &quot;clean&quot;

SAAT_30minC &lt;- filter(SAAT_30min_noNA, SAAT_30min_noNA$finalQF==0)



# Do any quality flags remain?

sum(SAAT_30minC$finalQF==1)

## [1] 0
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can plot only the unflagged data.</p>

<pre><code># plot temp data

tempPlot &lt;- ggplot(SAAT_30minC, aes(startDateTime, tempSingleMean)) +
    geom_point(size=0.3) +
    ggtitle(&quot;Single Aspirated Air Temperature&quot;) +
    xlab(&quot;Date&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Temp (C)&quot;) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face=&quot;bold&quot;, size = 20)) +
    theme(text = element_text(size=18))



tempPlot
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/biodiversity/neon-phenology-temp/02-drivers-pheno-change-temp/rfigs/plot-temp-clean-1.png" alt="Scatter plot of mean temperatures for the year 2018 at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI). Plotted data now has been cleaned of the erroneous sensor readings by filtering out flagged data."/></p>

<p>That looks better! But we&#39;re still working with the 30-minute data. </p>

<h2>Aggregate Data by Day</h2>

<p>We can use the dplyr package functions to aggregate the data. However, we have to
choose which data we want to aggregate. Again, you might want daily 
minimum temps, mean temperature or maximum temps depending on your question. </p>

<p>In the context of phenology, minimum temperatures might be very important if you
are interested in a species that is very frost susceptible. Any days with a 
minimum temperature below 0C could dramatically change the phenophase. For other 
species or climates, maximum thresholds may be very important. Or you might be most
interested in the daily mean.</p>

<p>And note that you can combine different input values with different aggregation 
functions - for example, you could calculate the minimum of the half-hourly 
average temperature, or the average of the half-hourly maximum temperature.</p>

<p>For this tutorial, let&#39;s use maximum daily temperature, i.e. the maximum of the 
<code>tempSingleMax</code> values for the day.</p>

<pre><code># convert to date, easier to work with

SAAT_30minC$Date &lt;- as.Date(SAAT_30minC$startDateTime)



# max of mean temp each day

temp_day &lt;- SAAT_30minC %&gt;%
    group_by(Date) %&gt;%
    distinct(Date, .keep_all=T) %&gt;%
    mutate(dayMax=max(tempSingleMaximum))
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can plot the cleaned up daily temperature. </p>

<pre><code># plot Air Temperature Data across 2018 using daily data

tempPlot_dayMax &lt;- ggplot(temp_day, aes(Date, dayMax)) +
    geom_point(size=0.5) +
    ggtitle(&quot;Daily Max Air Temperature&quot;) +
    xlab(&quot;&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Temp (C)&quot;) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face=&quot;bold&quot;, size = 20)) +
    theme(text = element_text(size=18))



tempPlot_dayMax
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/biodiversity/neon-phenology-temp/02-drivers-pheno-change-temp/rfigs/daily-max-plot-1.png" alt="Scatter plot of daily maximum temperatures(of 30 minute interval means) for the year 2018 at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI)."/></p>

<p>Thought questions: </p>

<ul>
<li>What do we gain by this visualization? </li>
<li>What do we lose relative to the 30 minute intervals?<br/></li>
</ul>

<h2>ggplot - Subset by Time</h2>

<p>Sometimes we want to scale the x- or y-axis to a particular time subset without 
subsetting the entire <code>data_frame</code>. To do this, we can define start and end 
times. We can then define these <code>limits</code> in the <code>scale_x_date</code> object as 
follows:</p>

<p><code>scale_x_date(limits=start.end) +</code></p>

<p>Let&#39;s plot just the first three months of the year. </p>

<pre><code># Define Start and end times for the subset as R objects that are the time class

startTime &lt;- as.Date(&quot;2018-01-01&quot;)

endTime &lt;- as.Date(&quot;2018-03-31&quot;)



# create a start and end time R object

start.end &lt;- c(startTime,endTime)

str(start.end)

##  Date[1:2], format: &quot;2018-01-01&quot; &quot;2018-03-31&quot;

# View data for first 3 months only

<p>Now we have the temperature data matching our Phenology data from the previous 
tutorial, we want to save it to our computer to use in future analyses (or the
next tutorial). This is optional if you are continuing directly to the next tutorial 
as you already have the data in R. </p>

<pre><code># Write .csv - this step is optional 

# This will write to the working directory we set at the start of the tutorial

write.csv(temp_day , file=&quot;NEONsaat_daily_SCBI_2018.csv&quot;, row.names=F)
