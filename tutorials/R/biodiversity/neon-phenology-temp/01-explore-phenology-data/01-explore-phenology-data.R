As such, before plotting, we can convert our count data into a percentage by writting an expression that divides the number of individuals with a 'yes' for the phenophase of interest, 'Leaves', by the total number of individuals and then multiplies the result by 100. Using this newly generated dataset of percentages, we can plot the data similarly to how we did in the previous plot. Only this time, the y-axis range goes from 0 to 100 to reflect the percentage data we just generated. The resulting plot now shows a bar plot of the proportion of Liriodendrum tulipifera (LITU) individuals from January 2017 through December 2019 at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI).
