## What is an API?

If you are unfamiliar with the concept of an API, think of  an API as a 
‘middle person' that provides a communication path for a software application 
to obtain information from a digital data source. APIs are becoming a very 
common means of sharing digital information. Many of the apps that you use on 
your computer or mobile device to produce maps, charts, reports, and other 
useful forms of information pull data from multiple sources using APIs. In 
the ecological and environmental sciences, many researchers use APIs to 
programmatically pull data into their analyses. (Quoted from the NEON Observatory
Blog story: 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/observatory/observatory-blog/api-data-availability-viewer-now-live-neon-data-portal" target ="_blank"> API and data availability viewer now live on the NEON data portal</a>.)

### What is accessible via the NEON API?

The NEON API includes endpoints for NEON data and metadata, including 
spatial data, taxonomic data, and samples (see Endpoints below). This 
tutorial explores these sources of information using a specific data 
product as a guide. The principles and rule sets described below can 
be applied to other data products and metadata.

## Anatomy of an API call

An example API call: http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/data/DP1.10003.001/WOOD/2015-07

This includes the base URL, endpoint, and target.

### Base URL: 
<span style="color:#A00606;font-weight:bold">http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0</span><span style="color:#A2A4A3">/data/DP1.10003.001/WOOD/2015-07</span>

Specifics are appended to this in order to get the data or metadata you're 
looking for, but all calls to an API will include the base URL. For the NEON 
API, this is http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0 --
not clickable, because the base URL by itself will take you nowhere!

### Endpoints: 
<span style="color:#A2A4A3">http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0</span><span style="color:#A00606;font-weight:bold">/data</span><span style="color:#A2A4A3">/DP1.10098.001/WOOD/2015-07</span>

What type of data or metadata are you looking for?

* **~/products**
  Information about one or all of NEON's data products

* **~/sites**
  Information about data availability at the site specified in the call

* **~/locations**
  Spatial data for the NEON locations specified in the call

* **~/data**
  Data! By product, site, and date (in monthly chunks)
  
* **~/samples**
  Information about sample relationships and sample tracking
  
* **~/taxonomy**
  Access to NEON's taxon lists, the approved scientific names for sampled taxa

### Targets:
<span style="color:#A2A4A3">http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/data</span><span style="color:#A00606;font-weight:bold">/DP1.10098.001/WOOD/2015-07</span>

The specific data product, location, sample, etc, you want to get data for.


## Data, by way of Products

Which product do you want to get data for? Consult the <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-products/explore" target="_blank">Explore Data Products page</a>.

We'll pick Woody vegetation structure, DP1.10098.001

Your first thought is probably to use the **/data** endpoint. And we'll get 
there. But notice above that the API call for the **/data** endpoint includes 
the site and month of data to download. You don't want to have to guess sites 
and months at random - first, you need to see which sites and months have 
available data for the product you're interested in. That can be done either 
through the **/sites** or the **/products** endpoint; here we'll use 
**/products**.

**Note:** Checking for data availability can sometimes be skipped for the 
streaming sensor data products. In general, they are available continuously, 
and you could theoretically query a site and month of interest and expect 
there to be data by default. However, there can be interruptions to sensor 
data, in particular at aquatic sites, so checking availability first is the 
most reliable approach.

Use the products endpoint to query for Woody vegetation data. The target is 
the data product identifier, noted above, DP1.10098.001:

```{r os-avail-query}

# Load the necessary libraries
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)

# Request data using the GET function & the API call
req <- GET("http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/products/DP1.10098.001")
req

```

The object returned from `GET()` has many layers of information. Entering the 
name of the object gives you some basic information about what you accessed. 
`Status: 200` indicates this was a successful query; the status field can be 
a useful place to look if something goes wrong.

The `Content-Type` parameter tells us we've accessed a json file. The easiest 
way to translate this to something more manageable in R is to use the 
`fromJSON()` function in the `jsonlite` package. It will convert the json into 
a nested list, flattening the nesting where possible.

```{r os-query-contents}

# Make the data readable by jsonlite
req.text <- content(req, as="text")

# Flatten json into a nested list
avail <- jsonlite::fromJSON(req.text, 
                            simplifyDataFrame=T, 
                            flatten=T)

```

A lot of the content here is basic information about the data product. 
You can see all of it by running the line `print(avail)`, but
this will result in a very long printout in your console. Instead, try viewing 
list items individually. Here, we highlight a couple of interesting examples:

```{r os-query-contents-examples}

# View description of data product
avail$data$productDescription

# View data product abstract
avail$data$productAbstract

```

You may notice that some of this information is also accessible on the NEON 
data portal. The portal uses the same data sources as the API, and in many 
cases the portal is using the API on the back end, and simply adding a more 
user-friendly display to the data.

We want to find which sites and months have available data. That is in the 
`siteCodes` section. Let's look at what information is presented for each 
site:

```{r os-query-fromJSON}

# Look at the first list element for siteCode
avail$data$siteCodes$siteCode[[1]]

# And at the first list element for availableMonths
avail$data$siteCodes$availableMonths[[1]]

```

Here we can see the list of months with data for the site ABBY, which is 
the Abby Road forest in Washington state.

The section `$data$siteCodes$availableDataUrls` provides the exact API 
calls we need in order to query the data for each available site and month. 

```{r os-query-avail-data}

# Get complete list of available data URLs
wood.urls <- unlist(avail$data$siteCodes$availableDataUrls)

# Total number of URLs
length(wood.urls)

# Show first 10 URLs available
wood.urls[1:10] 

```

These URLs are the API calls we can use to find out what files are available 
for each month where there are data.

Let's look at the woody plant data from the Rocky Mountain National Park 
(RMNP) site from October 2019. We can do this by using the `GET()` function 
on the relevant URL, which we can find using the `grep()` function. 

Note that if you want data from more than one site/month you need to iterate 
this code, `GET()` fails if you give it more than one URL at a time. 

```{r os-query-woody-data-urls}

# Get available data for RMNP Oct 2019
woody <- GET(wood.urls[grep("RMNP/2019-10", wood.urls)])
woody.files <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(woody, as="text"))

# See what files are available for this site and month
woody.files$data$files$name

```

STOPPED HERE

In this output, `name` and `url` are key fields. It provides us with the names 
of the files available for this site and month, and URLs where we can get the 
files. We'll use the file names to pick which ones we want.

The available files include both **data** and **metadata**, and both the **basic**
and **expanded** data packages. Typically the expanded package includes additional 
quality or uncertainty data, either in additional files or additional fields 
than in the basic files. Basic and expanded data packages are available for 
most NEON data products (some only have basic). Metadata are described by file 
name below.

The format for most of the file names is:

**NEON.[domain number].[site code].[data product ID].[file-specific name].
[date of file creation]**

Some files omit the domain and site, since they're not specific to a 
location, like the data product readme. The date of file creation uses the 
ISO6801 format, in this case 20170720T182547Z, and can be used to determine 
whether data have been updated since the last time you downloaded.

Available files in our query for July 2015 at Woodworth are all of the following
(leaving off the initial NEON.D09.WOOD.10003.001): 

* **~.2015-07.expanded.20170720T182547Z.zip:** zip of all files in the expanded 
package

* **~.brd_countdata.2015-07.expanded.20170720T182547Z.csv:** count data table, 
expanded package version: counts of birds at each point

* **~.brd_perpoint.2015-07.expanded.20170720T182547Z.csv:** point data table, 
expanded package version: metadata at each observation point

* **NEON.Bird Conservancy of the Rockies.brd_personnel.csv:** personnel data 
table, accuracy scores for bird observers

* **~.2015-07.basic.20170720T182547Z.zip:** zip of all files in the basic package

* **~.brd_countdata.2015-07.basic.20170720T182547Z.csv:** count data table, 
basic package version: counts of birds at each point

* **~.brd_perpoint.2015-07.basic.20170720T182547Z.csv:** point data table, 
basic package version: metadata at each observation point

* **NEON.DP1.10003.001_readme.txt:** readme for the data product (not specific 
to dates or location). Appears twice in the list, since it's in both the basic 
and expanded package

* **~.20150101-20160613.xml:** Ecological Metadata Language (EML) file. Appears 
twice in the list, since it's in both the basic and expanded package
  
* **~.validation.20170720T182547Z.csv:** validation file for the data product, 
lists input data and data entry rules. Appears twice in the list, since it's in 
both the basic and expanded package
  
* **~.variables.20170720T182547Z.csv:** variables file for the data product, 
lists data fields in downloaded tables. Appears twice in the list, since it's 
in both the basic and expanded package


We'll get the data tables for the point data and count data in the basic 
package. The list of files doesn't return in the same order every time, so we 
won't use position in the list to select. Plus, we want code we can re-use 
when getting data from other sites and other months. So we select files 
based on the data table name and the package name.


```{r os-get-bird-data}

# Get both files
brd.count <- read.delim(brd.files$data$files$url
                        [intersect(grep("countdata", 
                                        brd.files$data$files$name),
                                    grep("basic", 
                                         brd.files$data$files$name))], 
                        sep=",")

brd.point <- read.delim(brd.files$data$files$url
                        [intersect(grep("perpoint", 
                                        brd.files$data$files$name),
                                    grep("basic", 
                                         brd.files$data$files$name))], 
                        sep=",")

```

Now we have the data and can access it in R. Just to show that the files we 
pulled have actual data in them, let's make a quick graphic:

```{r os-plot-bird-data}
# Cluster by species 
clusterBySp <- brd.count %>%
  dplyr::group_by(scientificName) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(total=sum(clusterSize, na.rm=T))

# Reorder so list is ordered most to least abundance
clusterBySp <- clusterBySp[order(clusterBySp$total, decreasing=T),]

# Plot
barplot(clusterBySp$total, names.arg=clusterBySp$scientificName, 
        ylab="Total", cex.names=0.5, las=2)

```

Wow! There are lots of *Agelaius phoeniceus* (Red-winged Blackbirds) at WOOD in July. 


## Instrumentation data (IS)

The process is essentially the same for sensor data. We'll do the same series of 
queries for Soil Temperature, DP1.00041.001. Let's use data from Moab in March 
2017 this time.

```{r soil-data}
# Request soil temperature data availability info
req.soil <- GET("http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/products/DP1.00041.001")

# make this JSON readable
# Note how we've change this from two commands into one here
avail.soil <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(req.soil, as="text"), simplifyDataFrame=T, flatten=T)

# get data availability list for the product
temp.urls <- unlist(avail.soil$data$siteCodes$availableDataUrls)

# get data availability from location/date of interest
tmp <- GET(temp.urls[grep("MOAB/2017-08", temp.urls)])
tmp.files <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(tmp, as="text"))
length(tmp.files$data$files$name) # There are a lot of available files
tmp.files$data$files$name[1:10]   # Let's print the first 10

```

These file names start and end the same way as the observational files, but the 
middle is a little more cryptic. The structure from beginning to end is: 

**NEON.[domain number].[site code].[data product ID].
[soil plot number].[depth].[averaging interval].[data table name].
[year]-[month].[data package].[date of file creation]**

So **NEON.D13.MOAB.DP1.00041.001.00000.003.506.030.ST_30_minute.
2017-08.expanded.20200620T054008Z.csv** is the: 

* NEON (`NEON.`)
* Domain 13 (`.D13.`)
* Moab field site (`.MOAB.`) 
* soil temperature data (`.DP1.00041.001.`)
* collected in Soil Plot 3, (`.003.`)
* at the 6th depth below the surface (`.506.`)
* and reported as a 30-minute mean of (`.030.` and `.ST_30_minute.`)
* only for the period of Aug 2017 (`.2017-08.`)
* and provided in the basic data package (`.basic.`)
* published on June 20, 2020 at 05:40:08 GMT (`.20200620T054008Z.`).

More information about interpreting file names can be found on the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/data-management/data-formats-conventions" target="_blank">Data Formats</a> page.

Let's get data (and the URL) for only the plot and depth described above by selecting 
`003.506.030` and the word `basic` in the file name.

Go get it:

``` {r os-get-soil-data}

soil.temp <- read.delim(tmp.files$data$files$url
                        [intersect(grep("003.506.030", 
                                        tmp.files$data$files$name),
                                   grep("basic", 
                                        tmp.files$data$files$name))], 
                        sep=",")

```

Now we have the data and can use it to conduct our analyses. To take 
a quick look at it, let's plot the mean soil temperature by date. 

``` {r os-plot-soil-data}
# plot temp ~ date
plot(soil.temp$soilTempMean~as.POSIXct(soil.temp$startDateTime, 
                                       format="%Y-%m-%d T %H:%M:%S Z"), 
     pch=".", xlab="Date", ylab="T")

```

As we'd expect we see daily fluctuation in soil temperature, and some change 
in temperature over the month as well.


## Remote sensing data (AOP)

Again, the process of determining which sites and time periods have data, and 
finding the URLs for those data, is the same as for the other data types. We'll 
go looking for High resolution orthorectified camera imagery, DP1.30010, and 
we'll look at the flight over San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) in March 
2017.

```{r aop-data}
# Request camera data availability info
req.aop <- GET("http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/products/DP1.30010.001")

# make this JSON readable
# Note how we've changed this from two commands into one here
avail.aop <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(req.aop, as="text"), 
                      simplifyDataFrame=T, flatten=T)

# get data availability list for the product
cam.urls <- unlist(avail.aop$data$siteCodes$availableDataUrls)

# get data availability from location/date of interest
cam <- GET(cam.urls[intersect(grep("SJER", cam.urls),
                              grep("2017", cam.urls))])
cam.files <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(cam, as="text"))

# this list of files is very long, so we'll just look at the first ten
head(cam.files$data$files$name, 10)

```

File names for AOP data are more variable than for IS or OS data; 
different AOP data products use different naming conventions. 
File formats differ by product as well.

This particular product, camera imagery, is stored in TIFF files. 
For a full list of AOP data products, their naming conventions, and 
their file formats, see <link pending>.

Instead of reading a TIFF into R, we'll download it to the working 
directory. This is one option for getting AOP files from the API; if 
you plan to work with the files in R, you'll need to know how to 
read the relevant file types into R. We hope to add tutorials for 
this in the near future.

To download the TIFF file, we use the `downloader` package, and we'll 
select a file based on the time stamp in the file name: `20170328192931`

``` {r download-aop-data, eval=FALSE}

download(cam.files$data$files$url[grep("20170328192931", 
                                       cam.files$data$files$name)],
         paste(getwd(), "/SJER_image.tif", sep=""), mode="wb")

```


The image, below, of the San Joaquin Experimental Range should now be in your 
working directory.

## Geolocation data

You may have noticed some of the spatial data referenced above are a bit vague, 
e.g. "soil plot 2, 4th depth below the surface."

How to get spatial data and what to do with it depends on which type of 
data you're working with.

#### Instrumentation data (both aquatic and terrestrial)
The sensor_positions files, which are included in the list of available files, 
contain spatial coordinates for each sensor in the data. See the final section 
of the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neon-spatial-data-basics" target="_blank">Geolocation tutorial</a> for guidance in using these files.

#### Observational data - Aquatic
Latitude, longitude, elevation, and associated uncertainties are included in 
data downloads. Most products also include an "additional coordinate uncertainty" 
that should be added to the provided uncertainty. Additional spatial data, such 
as northing and easting, can be downloaded from the API.

#### Observational data - Terrestrial
Latitude, longitude, elevation, and associated uncertainties are included in 
data downloads. These are the coordinates and uncertainty of the sampling plot; 
for many protocols it is possible to calculate a more precise location. 
Instructions for doing this are in the respective data product user guides, and 
code is in the `geoNEON` package on GitHub.

### Querying a single named location
Let's look at the named locations in the bird data we downloaded above. To do this, 
look for the field called `namedLocation`, which is present in all observational 
data products, both aquatic and terrestrial.

```{r get-bird-NLs}
# view named location
head(brd.point$namedLocation)

```

Here we see the first six entries in the `namedLocation` column which tells us
the names of the Terrestrial Observation plots where the bird surveys were 
conducted. 

We can query the locations endpoint of the API for the first named location, 
`WOOD_013.birdGrid.brd`. 

```{r brd-ex-NL}
# location data 
req.loc <- GET("http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/locations/WOOD_013.birdGrid.brd")

# make this JSON readable
brd.WOOD_013 <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(req.loc, as="text"))
brd.WOOD_013

```

Note spatial information under `$data$[nameOfCoordinate]` and under 
`$data$locationProperties`. Also note `$data$locationChildren`: these are the 
finer scale locations that can be used to calculate precise spatial data for 
bird observations.

For convenience, we'll use the `geoNEON` package to make the calculations. 
First we'll use `getLocByName()` to get the additional spatial information 
available through the API, and look at the spatial resolution available in the 
initial download:

```{r brd-extr-NL}

# load the geoNEON package
library(geoNEON)

# extract the spatial data
brd.point.loc <- getLocByName(brd.point)

# plot bird point locations 
# note that decimal degrees is also an option in the data
symbols(brd.point.loc$easting, brd.point.loc$northing, 
        circles=brd.point.loc$coordinateUncertainty, 
        xlab="Easting", ylab="Northing", tck=0.01, inches=F)

```

And use `getLocTOS()` to calculate the point locations of observations.

```{r brd-calc-NL}

brd.point.pt <- getLocTOS(brd.point, "brd_perpoint")


# plot bird point locations 
# note that decimal degrees is also an option in the data
symbols(brd.point.pt$adjEasting, brd.point.pt$adjNorthing, 
        circles=brd.point.pt$adjCoordinateUncertainty, 
        xlab="Easting", ylab="Northing", tck=0.01, inches=F)

```

Now you can see the individual points where the respective point counts were 
located. 

## Taxonomy

NEON maintains accepted taxonomies for many of the taxonomic identification 
data we collect. NEON taxonomies are available for query via the API; they 
are also provided via an interactive user interface, the <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/static/taxon.html" target="_blank">Taxon Viewer</a>.

NEON taxonomy data provides the reference information for how NEON 
validates taxa; an identification must appear in the taxonomy lists 
in order to be accepted into the NEON database. Additions to the lists 
are reviewed regularly. The taxonomy lists also provide the author 
of the scientific name, and the reference text used.

The taxonomy endpoint of the API works a little bit differently from the 
other endpoints. In the "Anatomy of an API Call" section above, each 
endpoint has a single type of target - a data product number, a named 
location name, etc. For taxonomic data, there are multiple query 
options, and some of them can be used in combination.
For example, a query for taxa in the Pinaceae family:

<span style="color:#A2A4A3">http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/taxonomy</span><span style="color:#A00606;font-weight:bold">/?family=Pinaceae</span>

The available types of queries are listed in the <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-api#!/taxonomy/Get_taxonomy" target="_blank">taxonomy section</a> 
of the API web page. Briefly, they are:

* `taxonTypeCode`: Which of the taxonomies maintained by NEON are you 
looking for? BIRD, FISH, PLANT, etc. Cannot be used in combination 
with the taxonomic rank queries.
* each of the major taxonomic ranks from genus through kingdom
* `scientificname`: Genus + specific epithet (+ authority). Search is 
by exact match only, see final example below.
* `verbose`: Do you want the short (`false`) or long (`true`) response
* `offset`: Skip this number of items in the list. Defaults to 50.
* `limit`: Result set will be truncated at this length. Defaults to 50.

Staff on the NEON project have plans to modify the settings for `offset` 
and `limit`, such that `offset` will default to 0 and `limit` will default 
to ∞, but in the meantime users will want to set these manually. They are 
set to non-default values in the examples below.

For the first example, let's query for the loon family, Gaviidae, in the 
bird taxonomy. Note that query parameters are case-sensitive.

```{r get-loons}
loon.req <- GET("http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/taxonomy/?family=Gaviidae&offset=0&limit=500")
```

Parse the results into a list using `fromJSON()`:

```{r parse-loons}
loon.list <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(loon.req, as="text"))
```

And look at the `$data` element of the results, which contains:

* The full taxonomy of each taxon
* The short taxon code used by NEON (taxonID/acceptedTaxonID)
* The author of the scientific name (scientificNameAuthorship)
* The vernacular name, if applicable
* The reference text used (nameAccordingToID)

The terms used for each field are matched to Darwin Core (dwc) and 
the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (gbif) terms, where 
possible, and the matches are indicated in the column headers.

```{r display-loons}
loon.list$data
```

To get the entire list for a particular taxonomic type, use the 
`taxonTypeCode` query. Be cautious with this query, the PLANT taxonomic 
list has several hundred thousand entries.

For an example, let's look up the small mammal taxonomic list, which 
is one of the shorter ones, and use the `verbose=true` option to see 
a more extensive list of taxon data, including many taxon ranks that 
aren't populated for these taxa. For space here, we display only 
the first 10 taxa:

```{r get-mammals}
mam.req <- GET("http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/taxonomy/?taxonTypeCode=SMALL_MAMMAL&offset=0&limit=500&verbose=true")
mam.list <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(mam.req, as="text"))
mam.list$data[1:10,]
```

To get information about a single taxon, use the `scientificname` 
query. This query will not do a fuzzy match, so you need to query 
the exact name of the taxon in the NEON taxonomy. Because of this, 
the query will be most useful when you already have NEON data in 
hand and are looking for more information about a specific taxon. 
Querying on `scientificname` is unlikely to be an efficient way to 
figure out if NEON recognizes a particular taxon.

In addition, scientific names contain spaces, which are not 
allowed in a URL. The spaces need to be replaced with the URL 
encoding replacement, %20.

For an example, let's look up the little sand verbena, *Abronia 
minor Standl.* Searching for *Abronia minor* will fail, because 
the NEON taxonomy for this species includes the authority. The 
search will also fail with spaces. Search for 
`Abronia%20minor%20Standl.`, and in this case we can omit 
`offset` and `limit` because we know there can only be a single 
result:

```{r get-verbena}
am.req <- GET("http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/taxonomy/?scientificname=Abronia%20minor%20Standl.")
am.list <- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(am.req, as="text"))
am.list$data
```

## Stacking NEON data 

At the top of this tutorial, we installed the `neonUtilities` package. 
This is a custom R package that stacks the monthly files provided by 
the NEON data portal into a single continuous file for each type of 
data table in the download.

For a guide to using `neonUtilities` on data downloaded from the portal, 
check out the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/neonDataStackR" target="_blank">neonUtilities tutorial</a>.
