<p>This tutorial explores NEON geolocation data. The focus is on the locations 
of NEON observational sampling and sensor data; NEON remote sensing data are 
inherently spatial and have dedicated tutorials. If you are interested in 
connecting remote sensing with ground-based measurements, the methods in 
the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/tree-heights-veg-structure-chm" target="_blank">vegetation structure and canopy height model</a> 
tutorial can be generalized to other data products.</p>

<p>In planning your analyses, consider what level of spatial resolution is 
required. There is no reason to carefully map each measurement if precise 
spatial locations aren&#39;t required to address your hypothesis! For example, 
if you want to use the Vegetation structure 
data product to calculate a site-scale estimate of biomass and production, 
the spatial coordinates of each tree are probably not needed. If 
you want to explore relationships between vegetation and beetle communities, 
you will need to identify the sampling plots where NEON measures both beetles 
and vegetation, but finer-scale coordinates may not be needed. Finally, if 
you want to relate vegetation measurements to airborne remote sensing data, 
you will need very accurate coordinates for each measurement on the ground.</p>

<div id="ds-objectives" markdown="1">

## Learning Objectives 
After completing this tutorial you will be able to: 

* access NEON spatial data through data downloaded with the 
neonUtilities package.
* access and plot specific sampling locations for TOS data products. 
* access and use sensor location data. 

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Tutorial

### R Programming Language
You will need a current version of R to complete this tutorial. We also recommend 
the RStudio IDE to work with R. 

</div>

<h2>Setup R Environment</h2>

<p>We&#39;ll need several R packages in this tutorial. Install the packages, if not 
already installed, and load the libraries for each. </p>

<pre><code># run once to get the package, and re-run if you need to get updates

install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)  # plotting

install.packages(&quot;neonUtilities&quot;)  # work with NEON data

install.packages(&quot;neonOS&quot;)  # work with NEON observational data

install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;)  # to use the install_github() function

devtools::install_github(&quot;NEONScience/NEON-geolocation/geoNEON&quot;)  # work with NEON spatial data



# run every time you start a script

library(ggplot2)

library(neonUtilities)

library(neonOS)

library(geoNEON)

</code></pre>

<h2>Locations for observational data</h2>

<h3>Plot level locations</h3>

<p>Both aquatic and terrestrial observational data downloads include spatial 
data in the downloaded files. The spatial data in the aquatic data files 
are the most precise locations available for the sampling events. The 
spatial data in the terrestrial data downloads represent the locations of 
the sampling plots. In some cases, the plot is the most precise location 
available, but for many terrestrial data products, more precise locations 
can be calculated for specific sampling events.</p>

<p>Here, we&#39;ll download the Vegetation structure (DP1.10098.001) data 
product, examine the plot location data in the download, then calculate 
the locations of individual trees. These steps can be extrapolated to other 
terrestrial observational data products; the specific sampling layout 
varies from data product to data product, but the methods for working with 
the data are similar. </p>

<p>First, let&#39;s download the vegetation structure data from one site, Wind 
River Experimental Forest (WREF).</p>

<p>If downloading data using the <code>neonUtilities</code> package is new to you, check out 
the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/download-explore-neon-data" target="_blank">Download and Explore</a> tutorial.</p>

<pre><code># load veg structure data

vst &lt;- loadByProduct(dpID=&quot;DP1.10098.001&quot;, 
                     site=&quot;WREF&quot;,
                     check.size=F)
</code></pre>

<p>Data downloaded this way are stored in R as a large list. For this tutorial, 
we&#39;ll work with the individual dataframes within this large list. 
Alternatively, each dataframe can be assigned as its own object. </p>

<p>To find the spatial data for any given data product, view the variables files 
to figure out which data table the spatial data are contained in. </p>

<pre><code>View(vst$variables_10098)
</code></pre>

<p>Looking through the variables, we can see that the spatial data 
(<code>decimalLatitude</code> and <code>decimalLongitude</code>, etc) are in the 
<code>vst_perplotperyear</code> table. Let&#39;s take a look at 
the table. </p>

<pre><code>View(vst$vst_perplotperyear)
</code></pre>

<p>As noted above, the spatial data here are at the plot level; the 
latitude and longitude represent the centroid of the sampling plot. 
We can map these plots on the landscape using the <code>easting</code> and 
<code>northing</code> variables; these are the UTM coordinates. At this site, 
tower plots are 40 m x 40 m, and distributed plots are 20 m x 20 m; 
we can use the <code>symbols()</code> function to draw boxes of the correct 
size.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll also use the <code>treesPresent</code> variable to subset to only 
those plots where trees were found and measured.</p>

<pre><code># start by subsetting data to plots with trees

vst.trees &lt;- vst$vst_perplotperyear[which(
        vst$vst_perplotperyear$treesPresent==&quot;Y&quot;),]



# make variable for plot sizes

plot.size &lt;- numeric(nrow(vst.trees))



# populate plot sizes in new variable

plot.size[which(vst.trees$plotType==&quot;tower&quot;)] &lt;- 40

plot.size[which(vst.trees$plotType==&quot;distributed&quot;)] &lt;- 20



# create map of plots

symbols(vst.trees$easting,
        vst.trees$northing,
        squares=plot.size, inches=F,
        xlab=&quot;Easting&quot;, ylab=&quot;Northing&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/NEON-general/neon-code-packages/spatialData/rfigs/plot-plots-1.png" alt="All vegetation structure plots at WREF"/></p>

<p>We can see where the plots are located across the landscape, and 
we can see the denser cluster of plots in the area near the 
micrometeorology tower.</p>

<p>For many analyses, this level of spatial data may be sufficient. 
Calculating the precise location of each tree is only required for 
certain hypotheses; consider whether you need these data when 
working with a data product with plot-level spatial data.</p>

<p>Looking back at the <code>variables_10098</code> table, notice that there is 
a table in this data product called <code>vst_mappingandtagging</code>, 
suggesting we can find mapping data there. Let&#39;s take a look.</p>

<pre><code>View(vst$vst_mappingandtagging)
</code></pre>

<p>Here we see data fields for <code>stemDistance</code> and <code>stemAzimuth</code>. Looking 
back at the <code>variables_10098</code> file, we see these fields contain the 
distance and azimuth from a <code>pointID</code> to a specific stem. To calculate 
the precise coordinates of each tree, we would need to get the locations 
of the <code>pointID</code>s, and then adjust the coordinates based on distance and 
azimuth. The <strong>Data Product User Guide</strong> describes how to carry out these 
steps, and can be downloaded from the 
<a href="https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10098.001" target="_blank">Data Product Details page</a>.</p>

<p>However, carrying out these calculations yourself is not the only option! 
The <code>geoNEON</code> package contains a function that can do this for you, for 
the TOS data products with location data more precise than the plot level.</p>

<h3>Sampling locations</h3>

<p>The <code>getLocTOS()</code> function in the <code>geoNEON</code> package uses the NEON API to 
access NEON location data and then makes protocol-specific calculations 
to return precise locations for each sampling effort. This function works for a 
subset of NEON TOS data products. The list of tables and data products that can 
be entered is in the 
<a href="https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-geolocation/tree/master/geoNEON" target="_blank">package documentation on GitHub</a>. </p>

<p>For more information about the NEON API, see the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/neon-api-usage" target="_blank">API tutorial</a> 
and the 
<a href="https://data.neonscience.org/data-api" target="_blank">API web page</a>. 
For more information about the location calculations used in each data product, 
see the <strong>Data Product User Guide</strong> for each product.</p>

<p>The <code>getLocTOS()</code> function requires two inputs:</p>

<ul>
<li>A data table that contains spatial data from a NEON TOS data product</li>
<li>The NEON table name of that data table</li>
</ul>

<p>For vegetation structure locations, the function call looks like this. This 
function may take a while to download all the location data. For faster 
downloads, use an <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neon-api-tokens-tutorial" target="_blank">API token</a>.</p>

<pre><code># calculate individual tree locations

vst.loc &lt;- getLocTOS(data=vst$vst_mappingandtagging,
                     dataProd=&quot;vst_mappingandtagging&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>What additional data are now available in the data obtained by <code>getLocTOS()</code>?</p>

<pre><code># print variable names that are new

names(vst.loc)[which(!names(vst.loc) %in% 
                      names(vst$vst_mappingandtagging))]

## [1] &quot;utmZone&quot;                  &quot;adjNorthing&quot;              &quot;adjEasting&quot;              
## [4] &quot;adjCoordinateUncertainty&quot; &quot;adjDecimalLatitude&quot;       &quot;adjDecimalLongitude&quot;     
## [7] &quot;adjElevation&quot;             &quot;adjElevationUncertainty&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have adjusted latitude, longitude, and elevation, and the 
corresponding easting and northing UTM data. We also have coordinate 
uncertainty data for these coordinates. </p>

<p>As we did with the plots above, we can use the easting and northing 
data to plot the locations of the individual trees.</p>

<pre><code>plot(vst.loc$adjEasting, vst.loc$adjNorthing, 
     pch=&quot;.&quot;, xlab=&quot;Easting&quot;, ylab=&quot;Northing&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/NEON-general/neon-code-packages/spatialData/rfigs/vst-all-trees-1.png" alt="All mapped tree locations at WREF"/></p>

<p>We can see the mapped trees in the same plots we mapped above. 
We&#39;ve plotted each individual tree as a <code>.</code>, so all we can see at 
this scale is the cluster of dots that make up each plot.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s zoom in on a single plot:</p>

<pre><code>plot(vst.loc$adjEasting[which(vst.loc$plotID==&quot;WREF_085&quot;)], 
     vst.loc$adjNorthing[which(vst.loc$plotID==&quot;WREF_085&quot;)], 
     pch=20, xlab=&quot;Easting&quot;, ylab=&quot;Northing&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/NEON-general/neon-code-packages/spatialData/rfigs/plot-WREF_085-1.png" alt="Tree locations in plot WREF_085"/></p>

<p>Now we can see the location of each tree within the sampling plot WREF_085. 
This is interesting, but it would be more interesting if we could see more 
information about each tree. How are species distributed across the plot, 
for instance?</p>

<p>We can plot the tree species at each location using the <code>text()</code> function 
and the <code>vst.loc$taxonID</code> field.</p>

<pre><code>plot(vst.loc$adjEasting[which(vst.loc$plotID==&quot;WREF_085&quot;)], 
     vst.loc$adjNorthing[which(vst.loc$plotID==&quot;WREF_085&quot;)], 
     type=&quot;n&quot;, xlab=&quot;Easting&quot;, ylab=&quot;Northing&quot;)

text(vst.loc$adjEasting[which(vst.loc$plotID==&quot;WREF_085&quot;)], 
     vst.loc$adjNorthing[which(vst.loc$plotID==&quot;WREF_085&quot;)],
     labels=vst.loc$taxonID[which(vst.loc$plotID==&quot;WREF_085&quot;)],
     cex=0.5)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/NEON-general/neon-code-packages/spatialData/rfigs/plot-WREF_085-species-1.png" alt="Tree species and their locations in plot WREF_085"/></p>

<p>Almost all of the mapped trees in this plot are either <em>Pseudotsuga menziesii</em> 
or <em>Tsuga heterophylla</em> (Douglas fir and Western hemlock), not too 
surprising at Wind River.</p>

<p>But suppose we want to map the diameter of each tree? This is a very common 
way to present a stem map, it gives a visual as if we were looking down on 
the plot from overhead and had cut off each tree at its measurement height.</p>

<p>Other than taxon, the attributes of the trees, such as diameter, height, 
growth form, and canopy position, are found in the <code>vst_apparentindividual</code> 
table, not in the <code>vst_mappingandtagging</code> table. We&#39;ll need to join the 
two tables to get the tree attributes together with their mapped locations.</p>

<p>The <code>neonOS</code> package contains the function <code>joinTableNEON()</code>, which can be 
used to do this. See the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neonos-duplicates-joins" target="_blank">tutorial</a> for the <code>neonOS</code> package for more details 
about this function.</p>

<pre><code>veg &lt;- joinTableNEON(vst.loc, 
                     vst$vst_apparentindividual,
                     name1=&quot;vst_mappingandtagging&quot;,
                     name2=&quot;vst_apparentindividual&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can use the <code>symbols()</code> function to plot the diameter of each tree, 
at its spatial coordinates, to create a correctly scaled map of boles in 
the plot. Note that <code>stemDiameter</code> is in centimeters, while easting and 
northing UTMs are in meters, so we divide by 100 to scale correctly.</p>

<pre><code>symbols(veg$adjEasting[which(veg$plotID==&quot;WREF_085&quot;)], 
        veg$adjNorthing[which(veg$plotID==&quot;WREF_085&quot;)], 
        circles=veg$stemDiameter[which(veg$plotID==&quot;WREF_085&quot;)]/100/2, 
        inches=F, xlab=&quot;Easting&quot;, ylab=&quot;Northing&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/tutorials/R/NEON-general/neon-code-packages/spatialData/rfigs/plot-WREF_085-diameter-1.png" alt="Tree bole diameters in plot WREF_085"/></p>

<p>If you are interested in taking the vegetation structure data a step 
further, and connecting measurements of trees on the ground to remotely 
sensed Lidar data, check out the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/tree-heights-veg-structure-chm" target="_blank">Vegetation Structure and Canopy Height Model</a> tutorial.</p>

<p>If you are interested in working with other terrestrial observational (TOS) 
data products, the basic techniques used here to find precise sampling 
locations and join data tables can be adapted to other TOS data products. 
Consult the <strong>Data Product User Guide</strong> for each data product to find 
details specific to that data product.</p>

<h2>Locations for sensor data</h2>

<p>Downloads of instrument system (IS) data include a file called 
<strong>sensor_positions.csv</strong>. The sensor positions file contains information 
about the coordinates of each sensor, relative to a reference location. </p>

<p>While the specifics vary, techniques are generalizable for working with sensor 
data and the sensor_positions.csv file. For this tutorial, let&#39;s look at the 
sensor locations for soil temperature (PAR; DP1.00041.001) at<br/>
the NEON Treehaven site (TREE) in July 2018. To reduce our file size, we&#39;ll use 
the 30 minute averaging interval. Our final product from this section is to 
create a depth profile of soil temperature in one soil plot.</p>

<p>If downloading data using the <code>neonUtilties</code> package is new to you, check out the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/neonDataStackR" target="_blank">neonUtilities tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>This function will download about 7 MB of data as written so we have <code>check.size =F</code> 
for ease of running the code. </p>

<pre><code># load soil temperature data of interest 

soilT &lt;- loadByProduct(dpID=&quot;DP1.00041.001&quot;, site=&quot;TREE&quot;,
                    startdate=&quot;2018-07&quot;, enddate=&quot;2018-07&quot;,
                    timeIndex=30, check.size=F)

## Attempting to stack soil sensor data. Note that due to the number of soil sensors at each site, data volume is very high for these data. Consider dividing data processing into chunks, using the nCores= parameter to parallelize stacking, and/or using a high-performance system.
</code></pre>

<h3>Sensor positions file</h3>

<p>Now we can specifically look at the sensor positions file.</p>

<p>Soil temperature data are collected in 5 instrumented soil plots inside the 
tower footprint. We see this reflected in the data where HOR = 001 to 005. 
Within each plot, temperature is measured at 9 depths, seen in VER = 501 to 
509. At some sites, the number of depths may differ slightly.</p>

<p>The x, y, and z offsets in the sensor positions file are the relative distance, 
in meters, to the reference latitude, longitude, and elevation in the file. </p>

<p>The HOR and VER indices in the sensor positions file correspond to the

<p>Note that there are two sets of position data for soil plot 001, and that 
one set has a <code>positionEndDateTime</code> date in the file. This indicates sensors either 
moved or were relocated; in this case there was a frost heave incident. 
You can read about it in the issue log, which is displayed on the 
<a href="https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00041.001" target="_blank">Data Product Details</a> page, 
and also included as a table in the data download:</p>

## 1: Soil temperature sensors were pushed or pulled out of the ground by 3 cm over winter, presumably due to freeze-thaw action. The exact timing of this is unknown, but it occurred sometime between 2018-11-07 and 2019-04-19.
##                                                                                        resolution
## 1: Sensor depths were updated in the database with a start date of 2018-11-07 for the new depths.

<p>Since we&#39;re working with data from July 2018, and the change in 
sensor locations is dated Nov 2018, we&#39;ll use the original locations. 
There are a number of ways to drop the later locations from the 
table; here, we find the rows in which the <code>positionEndDateTime</code> field is empty, 
indicating no end date, and the rows corresponding to soil plot 001, 
and drop all the rows that meet both criteria.</p>

<pre><code>pos &lt;- pos[-intersect(grep(&quot;001.&quot;, pos$HOR.VER),
                      which(pos$positionEndDateTime==&quot;&quot;)),]
</code></pre>

<p>Our goal is to plot a time series of temperature, stratified by 
depth, so let&#39;s start by joining the data file and sensor positions 
file, to bring the depth measurements into the same data frame with 
the data.</p>

<pre><code># paste horizontalPosition and verticalPosition together

# to match HOR.VER in the sensor positions file

soilT$ST_30_minute$HOR.VER &lt;- paste(soilT$ST_30_minute$horizontalPosition,
                                    soilT$ST_30_minute$verticalPosition,
                                    sep=&quot;.&quot;)



# left join to keep all temperature records

soilTHV &lt;- merge(soilT$ST_30_minute, pos, 
                 by=&quot;HOR.VER&quot;, all.x=T)
</code></pre>

<p>And now we can plot soil temperature over time for each depth. 
We&#39;ll use <code>ggplot</code> since it&#39;s well suited to this kind of 
stratification. Each soil plot is its own panel, and each depth 
is its own line:</p>

<pre><code>gg &lt;- ggplot(soilTHV, 
             aes(endDateTime, soilTempMean, 
                 group=zOffset, color=zOffset)) +
             geom_line() + 
        facet_wrap(~horizontalPosition)

gg

## Warning: Removed 1488 rows containing missing values (`geom_line()`).

<p>We can see that as soil depth increases, temperatures 
become much more stable, while the shallowest measurement 
has a clear diurnal cycle. We can also see that 
something has gone wrong with one of the sensors in plot 
002. To remove those data, use only values where the final 
quality flag passed, i.e. <code>finalQF</code> = 0</p>

<pre><code>gg &lt;- ggplot(subset(soilTHV, finalQF==0), 
             aes(endDateTime, soilTempMean, 
                 group=zOffset, color=zOffset)) +
             geom_line() + 
        facet_wrap(~horizontalPosition)
