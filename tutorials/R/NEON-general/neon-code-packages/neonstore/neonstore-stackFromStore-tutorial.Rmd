Data storage and management have important implications for scientific 
reproducibility. This tutorial covers one possible workflow for managing 
NEON data downloads reproducibly, using a community-developed R package, 
`neonstore`.

NEON data are initially published as provisional, i.e. subject to change. 
Data in the provisional state may be re-processed and re-published on an 
as-needed basis, usually due to data quality procedures. Starting in 2021, 
an annual static Release of NEON data is published, containing most or 
all NEON data up to a data-type-specific provisional lag time. Data in a 
Release are associated with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and do 
not change throughout the lifetime of the observatory.

For more information about Data Releases and NEON's data processing 
pipelines, see the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/data-management" target="_blank">Data Management</a> pages on the NEON website, and the data 
pipeline videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NEONBetaEDU" target="_blank">NEON Science YouTube page</a>.

Since NEON data may change over time, either between Releases or during the 
provisional period, it's wise to keep the original data files used in a 
particular analysis or paper, in addition to any subsequent updated versions 
of those data files. The `neonstore` package offers a smooth, straightforward 
way to do this, and handles the file organization for you.

In this tutorial, we'll download data from three data products, examine the 
file structure `neonstore` places them in, and use the `neonUtilities` package to 
extract and stack a subset of data from each data product.


<div id="ds-objectives" markdown="1">

## Objectives
After completing this activity, you will be able to:

 * Download and manage NEON data using the `neonstore` package 
 * Extract and stack data from your `neonstore` archive 

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Tutorial
You will need a version of R (3.4.1 or higher) and, preferably, `RStudio` 
loaded on your computer to complete this tutorial.

### Install R Packages

* **neonstore**: `install.packages("neonstore")`
* **neonUtilities:** `install.packages("neonUtilities")`

## Additional Resources

* NEON <a href="http://data.neonscience.org" target="_blank"> Data Portal </a>
* <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/code-hub" target="_blank">NEON Code Hub</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/cboettig/neonstore" target="_blank">neonstore on GitHub</a>

## Set Up R and Local Storage Location

First install and load the necessary packages.

```{r setup, eval=c(7,8), results="hide"}

# install packages. can skip this step if already installed
install.packages("neonstore")
install.packages("neonUtilities")

# load packages
library(neonstore)
library(neonUtilities)

```

By default, neonstore will choose a directory to save the downloaded 
data. You can see where this is by checking the `neon_dir()` 
setting:

``` {r check-dir, results="hide"}

neon_dir()

```

Optional: Set the environment variable `NEONSTORE_HOME` to override 
the default directory and specify a file location you want to use 
to store your NEON data files.

```

# set to the file path you want to use
Sys.setenv(NEONSTORE_HOME = paste(getwd(), 
                                  "/data/neonstore",
                                  sep=""))

```

Note that you can't use `~` for file expansion in the environment variable.

You can also set `NEONSTORE_HOME` as a permanent environment variable, to 
avoid having to set it each time you use it. For instructions on setting 
a permanent environment variable, see the final section in the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neon-api-tokens-tutorial" target="_blank">API Token Tutorial</a>.

## Download Data

Let's imagine we're attempting to predict ecosystem carbon fluxes based 
on plant community composition and meteorology. We'll need to download three 
data products: Bundled eddy covariance (DP4.00200.001), Plant presence 
and percent cover (DP1.10058.001), and Single-aspirated air temperature 
(DP1.00002.001).

For simplicity, let's assume we're interested in only 3 sites, spanning a 
large latitudinal gradient: Toolik Lake (TOOL), Wind River (WREF), and 
Guanica (GUAN).

Download the data for each data product and site using the `neonstore` function 
`neon_download()`. We'll download 2019 data for eddy covariance and air 
temperature, and 2019-2020 for plant presence.

```{r download, results="hide", message=FALSE}

neon_download(product="DP4.00200.001", 
              start_date="2019-01-01",
              end_date="2020-01-01",
              type="basic",
              site=c("TOOL","WREF","GUAN"))

neon_download(product="DP1.00002.001", 
              start_date="2019-01-01",
              end_date="2020-01-01",
              type="basic",
              site=c("TOOL","WREF","GUAN"))

neon_download(product="DP1.10058.001", 
              start_date="2019-01-01",
              end_date="2021-01-01",
              type="expanded",
              site=c("TOOL","WREF","GUAN"))

```

Let's take a look at the file structure created for these data. 
The image below shows there is a folder for each data product, 
and the eddy covariance folder is opened, showing a sub-folder 
for each site. The Toolik site folder is open, showing 
sub-folders for each month of data. The data folder for May 
2019 is open, showing the data files.

<figure>

	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/neonstore-stackFromStore/neonstore-folders.png" alt="Folder structure of neonstore archive."></a>
</figure>

Some data and metadata files are stored at the level of the site 
sub-folder or the data product sub-folder; these files are not 
specific to a particular month, and are stored accordingly.

We just downloaded the currently available data, which are the most 
recent. Remember that one of our goals here is to retain traceable files 
even when data are updated. If you attempt to re-download the same data 
immediately, `neon_download()` will detect that the available files match 
the files you already have, and decline to download again:

```{r download-again, results="hide", message=FALSE}

neon_download(product="DP1.10058.001", 
              start_date="2019-01-01",
              end_date="2020-01-01",
              type="expanded",
              site=c("TOOL","WREF","GUAN"))

```

What would happen if files had been updated between the two downloads? We 
can't try that out in real time, because files are updated only 
occasionally, but here is an example folder containing multiple downloads 
of updated data:

<figure>
	<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/neonstore-stackFromStore/updated-files.png">
	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/neonstore-stackFromStore/updated-files.png" alt="Folder containing multiple files with differing publication dates."></a>
</figure>

You can see there are two copies of each file. The final 16-character 
string in each file name, before the file extension, is a publication 
time stamp in the form YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ. In this example, the first set of 
files were published on October 20, 2020, and the second set on December 
23, 2020. `neonstore` retains both. This allows you to work with the 
latest versions of NEON data, without losing traceability to previous 
versions.

## Extract and Stack Data

To work with the downloaded data, you'll generally want to merge the 
site-month tables, or extract variables from the H5 files, in the case of 
the eddy covariance data. The `stackFromStore()` function in `neonUtilities` 
can help you do this.

To learn about the basic stacking functionality in `neonUtilities`, consult 
the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/download-explore-neon-data" target="_blank">Download & Explore tutorial</a> and the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/eddy-data-intro" target="_blank">Eddy Flux tutorial</a>. 
The `stackFromStore()` function is a wrapper for the stacking functions 
described in those tutorials. In this tutorial we'll cover the use 
of `stackFromStore()`, but won't go into background detail about the 
stacking functions.

`stackFromStore()` pulls a subset of data from the `neonstore` archive, based 
on the input criteria, and stacks the data files. Let's get the Toolik and 
Wind River temperature, just from March and April 2019:

```{r stack-T, results="hide"}

temp <- stackFromStore(filepaths=neon_dir(),
                       dpID="DP1.00002.001", 
                       startdate="2019-03",
                       enddate="2019-04",
                       package="basic",
                       site=c("TOOL","WREF"))

```

Note that the `neonstore` directory is an input to the function, to tell it 
where to find the data. You can spell out the full file path, or get it 
via `neonstore` using the `neon_dir()` function.

Important: the basic vs. expanded package specification is repeated here. 
If you attempt to stack the expanded package from a basic package 
download, or vice versa, the stacking is likely to go awry. If you need 
the flexibility to work with either package locally, download both.

## Extract Data by Publication Date

As we've discussed, one of the major advantages of `neonstore` is its 
ability to store multiple versions of the same data with different 
publication dates. The default behavior in `stackFromStore()` is to 
return the most recently published data, but you can override this 
with the `pubdate=` input.

The `pubdate=` input will return the most recently published data with 
a publication date earlier than `pubdate`, i.e., the latest date before 
the `pubdate`. In general this should match the data you would have gotten 
if you had downloaded the data from the data portal on the date specified 
in `pubdate`. However, in NEON data processing the publication workflow 
generates the files and attaches the timestamps, and only after this is 
complete for a batch of files, the entire batch refreshes to the data 
portal and API. So the publication timestamp is generally slightly 
earlier than the date and time when the data became available.

And of course the availability for stacking from `neonstore` is limited 
to the files in your local storage; if a given set of files were 
re-published multiple times in between your downloads, you'll only have 
the versions you downloaded.

Let's get the Plant presence and percent cover data with a publication 
date no later than Jan 1, 2021. Start date, end date, and sites are 
unspecified to include all available.

```{r stack-div, results="hide", warning=FALSE}

pppc <- stackFromStore(filepaths=neon_dir(),
                       dpID="DP1.10058.001", 
                       pubdate="2021-01-01",
                       package="expanded")

```

You may encounter a warning message that the `div_morphospecies` table is 
not included in this dataset. That is fine in this case. The stacking code 
attempts to find every table described in the variables file. Tables may 
be missing for valid reasons, such as protocols with components that are 
not carried out every year. But missing tables can also be a sign 
of an error in function inputs, such as attempting to stack the expanded 
package after downloading the basic package. Check your function inputs 
if you see this message, and consult the Data Product User Guide for 
information about which data are expected to be available under what 
conditions.

And now check which data were included based on a publication date of 
2021-01-01:

```{r which-div}

unique(pppc$div_1m2Data$siteID)
min(pppc$div_1m2Data$endDate)
max(pppc$div_1m2Data$endDate)

```

All three sites are included, but only the 2019 data. The 2020 data 
hadn't been published yet on Jan 1, 2021.

## Stack Surface-Atmosphere Exchange Data

The inputs shown above for stacking observational and 
meteorological data can be used for surface-atmosphere exchange data 
as well. In this case, `stackFromStore()` is passing the data files 
to `stackEddy()` instead of `stackByTable()`, so we need to include 
the additional inputs required by `stackEddy()`.

Let's extract and stack the Level 4 flux data from Wind River, April 
and May 2019. For more details about `stackEddy()` options, see the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/eddy-data-intro" target="_blank">Flux Data tutorial</a>.

```{r stack-sae, results="hide"}

flux <- stackFromStore(filepaths=neon_dir(), 
                       dpID="DP4.00200.001", 
                       site="WREF",
                       startdate="2019-04",
                       enddate="2019-05",
                       package="basic", 
                       level="dp04")

```

## Final Notes and Suggestions

The workflow outlined above is a simple approach to downloading 
and stacking NEON data while retaining a reproducible file history. 
Keep in mind that using this workflow, we did not save the stacked 
data. In repeat analyses, the data would be stacked each time from 
the neonstore files. For large datasets, this could be quite 
time-consuming and annoying. In those cases, the stacked data could 
be written to file and accessed using the `readTableNEON()` function 
(see <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neondatastackr" target="_blank">neonUtilities tutorial</a>).

Alternatively, the stacked files could be stored in a small local 
database. The `neonstore` package includes an option for this, not 
covered in this tutorial, or you can implement a similar solution 
with your own code.
