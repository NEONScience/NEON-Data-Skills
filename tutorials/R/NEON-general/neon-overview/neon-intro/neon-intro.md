Here we will provide an overview of the National Ecological Observatory
Network (NEON). Please carefully read through these materials and links that
discuss NEON’s mission and design. 

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
**Data Institute participants**: As you review this information, please
consider the
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/di-rs-capstone" target="_blank">capstone project </a>
that you may want to work on at the Institute. At the end of week one, you will 
document an initial research question or idea and associated data needed to 
address that question, that you may want to explore while at the NEON Data Institute.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Explain the mission of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).
* Explain the how sites are located within the NEON project design.
* Explain the different types of data that will be collected and provided by
 NEON.
 </div>

## The NEON Project Mission & Design

To capture ecological heterogeneity across the United States, NEON’s design
divides the continent into 20 statistically different eco-climatic domains. Each
NEON field site is located within an eco-climatic domain.


#### The Science and Design of NEON

To gain a better understanding of the broad scope fo NEON watch this 4 minute long
video.

### NEON Field Site Locations

Explore the NEON Field Site map taking note of the locations of

1. Aquatic & terrestrial field sites.
2. Core & relocatable field sites.

<a class="link--button link--arrow" href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map" target="_blank">
Click here to view the NEON Field Site Map</a>

Explore the NEON field site map. Do the following:

* Zoom in on a study area of interest to see if there are any NEON field sites 
that are nearby.
* Use the menu below the map to 
filter sites by name, type, domain, or state.
* Select one field site of interest.
  * Click on the marker in the map.
  * Then click on Site Details to jump to the field site landing page.

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
**Data Institute Participant -- Thought Questions:**
Use the map above to answer these questions. Consider the research question that 
you may explore as your Capstone Project at the Institute or about a current 
project that you are working on and answer the following questions:

* Are there NEON field sites that are in study regions of interest to you?  
* What domains are the sites located in?  
* What NEON field sites do your current research or Capstone Project ideas
coincide with?  
* Is the site(s) core or relocatable?  
* Is it/are they terrestrial or aquatic?  
* Are there data available for the NEON field site(s) that you are most
interested in? What kind of data are available?

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
**Data Institute Participant – Thought Questions:** 
Consider either your current or future research or the question you’d like to 
address at the Institute.

* Which types of NEON data may be more useful to address these questions?
* What non-NEON data resources could be combined with NEON data to help address your question?
* What challenges, if any, could you foresee when beginning to work with these
data?
</div>

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** NEON also provides support to your own 
research including proposals to fly the AOP over other study sites, a mobile 
tower/instrumentation setup and others. Learn more here the

## Access NEON Data

NEON data are processed and go through quality assurance quality control checks 
at NEON headquarters in Boulder, CO.
NEON carefully documents every aspect of sampling design, data collection,
processing and delivery. This documentation is freely available through the
NEON data portal.

* Visit the 
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org/home" target="_blank">NEON Data Portal - data.neonscience.org </a>
* Read more about the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data/data-processing" target="_blank">quality assurance and quality control processes for NEON data</a> 
and how the data are processed from raw data to higher level data products.
* <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-products/explore" target="_blank">Explore NEON Data Products</a>. 
On the page for each data product in the catalog you can find the basic information 
about the product, find the data collection and processing protocols, and link 
directly to downloading the data. 
* Additionally, some types of NEON data are also available through the data portals
of other organizations. For example, 
<a href="http://www.ibol.org/dna-barcodes-for-neons-terrestrial-insects/" target="_blank"> NEON Terrestrial Insect DNA Barcoding Data</a>
is available through the
<a href="http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/databases" target="_blank"> Barcode of Life Datasystem (BOLD)</a>. 
Or NEON phenocam images are available from the 
<a href="https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/network/search/?sitename=neon&type=&primary_vegtype=&dominant_species=&active=1&fluxdata=1" target="_blank">Phenocam network site</a>. 
More details on where else the data are available from can be found in the Availability and Download
section on the Product Details page for each data product (visit 
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-products/explore" target="_blank">Explore Data Products</a> 
to access individual Product Details pages).

### Pathways to access NEON Data
There are several ways to access data from NEON: 

1. Via the <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/home" target="_blank">NEON data portal</a>. 
Explore and download data. Note that much of the tabular data is available in zipped 
.csv files for each month and site of interest. To combine these files, use the 
neonUtilities package (<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/neonDataStackR" target="_blank">R tutorial</a>, <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/neon-utilities-python" target="_blank">Python tutorial</a>).  
2. Use R or Python to programmatically access the data. NEON and community members
have created code packages to directly access the data through an API. Learn more
about the available resources by reading the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data/code-resources" target="_blank">Code Resources page</a> or visiting the 
<a href="https://github.com/NEONScience" target="_blank">NEONScience GitHub repo</a>.  
3. Using the <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-api" target="_blank">NEON API</a>. Access NEON data directly 
using a custom API call. 
4. Access NEON data through partner's portals. Where NEON data directly overlap
with other community resources, NEON data can be accessed through the portals. 
Examples include Phenocam, BOLD, Ameriflux, and others. You can learn more in the 
documentation for individual data products.

**Data Institute Participant – Thought Questions:** 
Use the Data Portal tools to investigate the data availability for the field
sites you’ve already identified in the previous Thought Questions. 

* What types of aquatic/terrestrial data are currently available? Remote sensing data?  
* Of these, what type of data are you most interested in working with for your project while at the Institute.  
* For what time period does the data cover?  
* What format is the downloadable file available in?  
* Where is the metadata to support this data?

**Data Institute Participants: Intro to NEON Culmination Activity**

Write up a brief summary of a project that you might want to explore while at the
Data Institute in Boulder, CO. Include the types of NEON (and other data) that you
will need to implement this project. Save this summary as you will be refining 
and adding to your ideas over the next few weeks.

The goal of this activity if for you to begin to think about the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/di-rs-capstone" target="_blank">capstone project </a> 
that you wish to work on while at the Data Institute. This project will ideally be 
performed in groups, so over the next few weeks you'll have a chance to view the other
project proposals and merge projects to collaborate with your colleagues.
