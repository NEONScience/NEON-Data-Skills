## About Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data

The electromagnetic spectrum is composed of thousands of bands representing 
different types of light energy. Imaging spectrometers (instruments that collect 
hyperspectral data) break the electromagnetic spectrum into groups of bands that 
support classification of objects by their spectral properties on the Earth's 
surface. Hyperspectral data consists of many bands - up to hundreds of bands - 
that cover the electromagnetic spectrum.

The NEON imaging spectrometer (NIS) collects data within the 380 nm to 2510 nm 
portions of the electromagnetic spectrum within bands that are approximately 5 nm 
in width. This results in a hyperspectral data cube that contains approximately 
428 bands - which means BIG DATA.

  represents a band.</figcaption>
</figure>
 
The HDF5 data model natively compresses data stored within it (makes it smaller) 
and supports data slicing (extracting only the portions of the data that you 
need to work with rather than reading the entire dataset into memory). These 
features in addition to the ability to support spatial data and associated 
metadata make it ideal for working with large data cubes such as those generated 
by imaging spectrometers.


In this tutorial we will explore reading and extracting spatial raster data 
stored within a HDF5 file using R. 

##  Read HDF5 data into R
We will use the `raster` and `rhdf5` packages to read in the HDF5 file that 
contains hyperspectral data for the 
<a href="/field-sites/field-sites-map/SJER" target="_blank">NEON San Joaquin (SJER) field site</a>. 
Let's start by calling the needed packages and reading in our NEON HDF5 file.  

Please be sure that you have *at least* version 2.10 of `rhdf5` installed. Use: 
`packageVersion("rhdf5")` to check the package version. 

```{r install-load-library, results="hide" }

# Load `raster` and `rhdf5` packages and read NIS data into R
library(raster)
library(rhdf5)
library(rgdal)

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where
# we want to save our files. Be sure to move the download into your working directory!
wd="~/Desktop/Hyperspectral_Tutorial/" #This will depend on your local environment
setwd(wd)

```

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** To update all packages installed in 
R, use `update.packages()`.
</div>

```{r view-file-strux }

# Define the file name to be opened
f <- paste0(wd,"NEONDSImagingSpectrometerData.h5")
# look at the HDF5 file structure 
h5ls(f,all=T) 

```

When you look at the structure of the data, take note of the `map info` dataset, 
the `spatialInfo` group, and the `wavelength` and `Reflectance` datasets. The 
`spatialInfo` folder contains the spatial attributes of the data including its 
Coordinate Reference System (CRS). The CRS documents how the data are physically 
located on the Earth. The `wavelength` dataset contains the middle wavelength 
values for each band in the data. The reflectance dataset contains the image data 
that we will use for both data processing and visualization.

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**Data Tip - HDF5 Structure:** Note that the structure 
of individual HDF5 files may vary depending on who produced the data. In this 
case, the Wavelength and reflectance data within the file are both datasets. 
However the spatial information is contained within a group. Data downloaded from 
another organization like NASA, may look different. This is why it's important to 
explore the data before diving into using it!
</div>

We can use the `h5readAttributes` function to read and extract metadata from the 
HDF5 file. Let's start by reading in the spatial information.


```{r read-spatial-attributes}

# get spatialInfo using the h5readAttributes function 
spInfo <- h5readAttributes(f,"spatialInfo")

# get attributes for the Reflectance dataset
reflInfo <- h5readAttributes(f,"Reflectance")


```

Next, let's read in the wavelength center associated with each band in the HDF5 
file. 

```{r read-band-wavelengths }

# read in the wavelength information from the HDF5 file
wavelengths<- h5read(f,"wavelength")

```

Which wavelength is band 19 associated with? (Hint: look at the wavelengths 
vector that we just imported and check out the data located at index 19 - 
`wavelengths[19]`).

<figure>

    <figcaption>472 nanometers falls within the blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Source: National Ecological Observatory Network </figcaption>
</figure>

Band 19 has a associate wavelength center or 0.47244 which is in micrometers. 
This value equates to 472.44 nanometers (nm) which is in the blue portion of
the visible electromagnetic spectrum (~ 400-700 nm). 

### Bands and Wavelengths

A *band* represents 
a group of wavelengths. For example, the wavelength values between 800nm and 805nm 
might be one band as captured by an imaging spectrometer. The imaging spectrometer
collects reflected light energy in a pixel for light in that band. Often when you 
work with a multi or hyperspectral dataset, the band information is reported as 
the center wavelength value. This value represents the center point value of the 
wavelengths represented in that  band. Thus in a band spanning 800-805 nm, the 
center would be 802.5 nm). The full width half max (FWHM) will also be reported. 
This value represents the spread of the band around that center point. So, a band 
that covers 800 nm-805 nm might have a FWHM of 2.5 and a wavelength value of 802.5.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/hyperspectral/spectrumZoomed.png"></a>
    <figcaption>Bands represent a range of values (types of light) within the 
    electromagnetic spectrum. Values for each band are often represented as the 
    center point value of each band.</figcaption>
</figure>

The HDF5 dataset that we are working with in this activity contains more 
information than we need to work with. For example, we don't necessarily need 
to process all 426 bands - if we are interested in creating a product like NDVI
which only users bands in the near infra-red and red portions of the spectrum. 
Or we might only be interested in a spatial subset of the data - perhaps a region 
where we have plots in the field.

The HDF5 format allows us to slice (or subset) the data - quickly extracting the 
subset that we need to process. Let's extract one of the green bands in our 
dataset - band 34. By the way - what is the center wavelength value associated 
with band 34? hint `wavelengths[34]`. How do we know this band is a green band 
in the visible portion of the spectrum?

```{r get-reflectance-shape}

# note that we can grab the dimensions of the dataset from the attributes
# we can then use that information to slice out our band data
nRows <- reflInfo$row_col_band[1]
nCols <- reflInfo$row_col_band[2]
nBands <- reflInfo$row_col_band[3]

nRows
nCols
nBands

```

The HDF5 read function reads data in the order: Cols, Rows and bands. This is 
different from how R reads data (rows, columns, bands). We'll adjust for this 
later.

```{r get-reflectance-shape-2}
# Extract or "slice" data for band 34 from the HDF5 file
b34<- h5read(f,"Reflectance",index=list(1:nCols,1:nRows,34))
 
# what type of object is b34?
class(b34)

```

### A Note About Data Slicing in HDF5
Data slicing allows us to extract and work with subsets of the data rather than 
reading in the entire dataset into memory. Thus, in this case, we can extract and 
plot the green band without reading in all 426 bands of information. The ability 
to slice large datasets, makes HDF5 ideal for working with big data. 	

Next, let's convert our data from an array (more than 2 dimensions) to a matrix 
(just 2 dimensions). We need to have our data in a matrix format to plot it.

```{r convert-to-matrix}

# convert from array to matrix
b34 <- b34[,,1]

# check it
class(b34)

```


### Arrays vs. Matrices

Arrays are matrices with more than 2 dimensions. When we say dimension, we are 
talking about the "z" 
associated with the data (imagine a series of tabs in a spreadsheet). Put the other 
way: matrices are arrays with only 2 dimensions. Arrays can have any number of 
dimensions one, two, ten or more. 

Here is a matrix that is 4 x 3 in size (4 rows and 3 columns):

| Metric    | species 1 | species 2 |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| total number   | 23        | 45        |
| average weight | 14        | 5         |
| average length | 2.4       | 3.5       |
| average height | 32        | 12        |

### Dimensions in Arrays
An array contains 1 or more dimensions in the "z" direction. For example, let's 
say that we collected 
this same set of species data for every day in a 30 day month. We might then have 
a matrix like the one above for each day for a total of 30 days making a 4 x 3 x 
30 array (this dataset has more than 2 dimensions). More on R object types 
<a href="http://www.statmethods.net/input/datatypes.html">here</a>.

    <figcaption>Right: a matrix has only 2 dimensions. Left: an array has more than 2 dimensions.</figcaption>
</figure>

Next, let's look at the metadata for the reflectance data. When we do this, take 
note of 1) the scale factor and 2) the data ignore value. Then we can plot the 
band 34 data. Plotting spatial data as a visual "data check" is a good idea to 
make sure processing is being performed correctly and all is well with the image. 

```{r read-attributes-plot}
    
# look at the metadata for the reflectance dataset
h5readAttributes(f,"Reflectance")

# plot the image
image(b34)

# oh, that doens't tell us much
# what happens if we plot a log of the data?
image(log(b34))

```

What do you notice about the first image? It's a bit dark and lacking any detail. What 
could be causing this? It got better when plotting the log of the values, but 
still not great. 

Let's look at the distribution of reflectance values in 
our data to figure out what is going on.

```{r hist-data }

# Plot range of reflectance values as a histogram to view range
# and distribution of values.
hist(b34,breaks=40,col="darkmagenta")

# View values between 0 and 5000
hist(b34,breaks=40,col="darkmagenta",xlim = c(0, 5000))
# View higher values
hist(b34, breaks=40,col="darkmagenta",xlim = c(5000, 15000),ylim=c(0,100))

```

As you're examining the histograms above, keep in mind that reflectance values 
range between 0-1. The **data scale factor** in the metadata tells us to divide 
all reflectance values by 10,000. Thus, a value of 5,000 equates to a reflectance 
value of 0.50. Storing data as integers (without decimal places) compared to 
floating points (with decimal places) creates a smaller file. You will see this 
done often when working with remote sensing data. 

Notice in the data that there are some larger reflectance values (>5,000) that 
represent a smaller number of pixels. These pixels are skewing how the image 
renders. 

### Data Ignore Value
Image data in raster 
format will often contain a data ignore value and a scale factor. The data ignore 
value represents pixels where there are no data. Among other causes, no data 
values may be attributed to the sensor not collecting data in that area of the 
image or to processing results which yield null values. 

Remember that the metadata for the `Reflectance` dataset designated 15,000 as 
`data ignore value`. Thus, let's set all pixels with a value == 15,000 to `NA` 
(no value). If we do this, R won't try to render these pixels.

```{r set-values-NA}

# there is a no data value in our raster - let's define it
myNoDataValue <- as.numeric(reflInfo$`data ignore value`)
myNoDataValue

# set all values greater than 15,000 to NA
b34[b34 == myNoDataValue] <- NA

# plot the image now
image(b34)

```

### Reflectance Values and Image Stretch

Our image still looks dark because R is trying to render all reflectance values 
between 0 and 14999 as if they were distributed equally in the histogram. However 
we know they are not distributed equally. There are many more values between 
0-5000 then there are values >5000. 

Images have a distribution of reflectance values. A typical image viewing program 
will render the values by distributing the entire range of reflectance values  
across a range of "shades" that the monitor can render - between 0 and 255. 
However, often the distribution of reflectance values is not linear. For example, 
in the case of our data, most of the reflectance values fall between 0 and 0.5. 
Yet there are a few values >1 that are heavily impacting the way the image is 
drawn on our monitor. Imaging processing programs like ENVI, QGIS and ArcGIS (and 
even Adobe Photoshop) allow you to adjust the stretch of the image. This is similar 
to adjusting the contrast and brightness in Photoshop. 

The proper way to adjust our data would be 
what's called an `image stretch`. We will learn how to stretch our image data, 
later. For now, let's plot the values as the log function on the pixel 
reflectance values to factor out those larger values. 

```{r plot-log }

image(log(b34))

```

The log applied to our image increases the contrast making it look more like an 
image. However, look at the images below. The top one is what our log adjusted 
image looks like when plotted. The bottom on is an RGB version of the same image. 
Notice a difference?

    <figcaption>LEFT: The image as it should look. RIGHT: the image that we outputted from the code above. Notice a difference?</figcaption>
</figure>



### Transpose Image

Notice that there are three data dimensions for this file: Bands x Rows x 
Columns. However, when R reads in the dataset, it reads them as: Columns x 
Bands x Rows. The data are flipped. We can quickly transpose the data to correct 
for this using the `t` or `transpose` command in R.

The orientation is rotated in our log adjusted image. This is because R reads 
in matrices starting from the upper left hand corner. Whereas, most rasters 
read pixels starting from the lower left hand corner. In the next section, we 
will deal with this issue by creating a proper georeferenced (spatially located) 
raster in R. The raster format will read in pixels following the same methods 
as other GIS and imaging processing software like QGIS and ENVI do.

```{r transpose-data}

# We need to transpose x and y values in order for our 
# final image to plot properly
b34<-t(b34)
image(log(b34), main="Transposed Image")


```


## Create a Georeferenced Raster

Next, we will create a proper raster using the `b34` matrix. The raster 
format will allow us to define and manage:

* Image stretch
* Coordinate reference system & spatial reference
* Resolution

It will also account for the orientation issue discussed above.
 
To create a raster in R, we need a few pieces of information, including: 

* The coordinate reference system (CRS)
* The location of the first pixel (located in the lower left hand corner of 
the raster). 
* The resolution or size of each pixel in the data. 

First, let's grab the spatial information that we need from the HDF5 file. 
The CRS and associated information that is needed is stored in the `map info`
dataset. 

The map info string looks something like this:

<br>
`"UTM,1.000,1.000,256521.000,4112571.000,1.000000e+000,`
`1.000000e+000,11,North,WGS-84,units=Meters" `. 
</br>

Notice that this information is separated by commas. We can use the 
`strsplit` command in R to extract each element into a vector. The elements are 
position 4 and 5 represent the lower left hand corner of the raster. We need 
this information to define the raster's extent.

```{r read-map-info}

# Populate the raster image extent value. 
# get the map info, split out elements
mapInfo<-h5read(f,"map info")

# Extract each element of the map info information 
# so we can extract the lower left hand corner coordinates.
mapInfo<-unlist(strsplit(mapInfo, ","))

# view the attributes in the map dataset
mapInfo

```

Next we define the extents of our raster. The extents will be used to calculate 
the raster's resolution. The lower left hand corner is located at mapInfo[4:5]. 
We can define the final raster dataset extent by adding the number of rows to 
the Y lower left hand corner coordinate and the number of columns in the 
`Reflectance` dataset to the X lower left hand corner coordinate.

		Observatory Network (NEON) </figcaption>

### Define Raster CRS

We have defined the extent of our raster but we still need to define the Coordinate 
reference system (`CRS`) of the raster. To do that, we can first grab the CRS
string from the HDF5 attributes. Then we can assign that CRS to the raster object.

```{r define-CRS}

# Create the projection in as object
myCRS <- spInfo$projdef
myCRS

# define final raster with projection info 
# note that capitalization will throw errors on a MAC.
# if UTM is all caps it might cause an error!
b34r <- raster(b34, 
        crs=myCRS)

b34r

#let's have a look at our properly positioned raster. Take note of the 
#coordinates on the x and y axis.

image(log(b34r), 
      xlab = "UTM Easting", 
      ylab = "UTM Northing",
      main = "Properly Positioned Raster")


```


```{r define-extent}

# grab resolution of raster as an object
res <- spInfo$xscale
res

# Grab the UTM coordinates of the upper left hand corner of the raster

#grab the left side x coordinate (xMin)
xMin <- as.numeric(mapInfo[4]) 
#grab the top corner coordinate (yMax)
yMax <- as.numeric(mapInfo[5])

xMin
yMax


# Calculate the lower right hand corner to define the full extent of the 
# raster. To do this we need the number of columns and rows in the raster
# and the resolution of the raster.

# note that you need to multiply the columns and rows by the resolution of 
# the data to calculate the proper extent!
xMax <- (xMin + (ncol(b34))*res)
yMin <- (yMax - (nrow(b34))*res) 

xMax
yMin

# define the extent (left, right, top, bottom)
rasExt <- extent(xMin,xMax,yMin,yMax)

rasExt

# assign the spatial extent to the raster
extent(b34r) <- rasExt

# look at raster attributes
b34r

```


We can adjust the colors of our raster too if we want.

```{r  plot-colors-raster }

#let's change the colors of our raster and adjust the zlims 
col=terrain.colors(25)

image(b34r,  
      xlab = "UTM Easting", 
      ylab = "UTM Northing",
      main= "Raster w Custom Colors",
      col=col, 
      zlim=c(0,3000))

```


We've now created a raster from band 34 reflectance data. We can export the data
as a raster, using the `writeRaster` command. 

```{r  write-raster,  eval=FALSE}

#write out the raster as a geotiff

writeRaster(b34r,
            file=paste0(wd,"band34.tif"),
            format="GTiff",
            overwrite=TRUE)

#It's always good practice to close the H5 connection before moving on!
#close the H5 file
H5close()

```

### Challenge: Work with Rasters

Try these three extensions on your own: 

1. Create rasters using other bands in the dataset.

2. Vary the distribution of values in the image to mimic an image stretch. 
e.g. `b34[b34 > 6000 ] <- 10000`

3. Use what you know to extract ALL of the reflectance values for
ONE pixel rather than for an entire band. HINT: this will require you to pick
an x and y value and then all values in the z dimension:
`aPixel<- h5read(f,"Reflectance",index=list(54,36,NULL))`. Plot the spectra 
output.
