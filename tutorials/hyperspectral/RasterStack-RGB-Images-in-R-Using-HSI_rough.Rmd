## About Hyperspectral Data 
We often want to generate a 3 band image from multi or hyperspectral data. The 
most commonly recognized band combination is RGB which stands for Red, Green and 
Blue. RGB images are just like the images that your camera takes. But there are 
other band combinations that are useful too. For example, near infrared images 
emphasize vegetation and help us classify or identify where vegetation is located 
on the ground.

## Create a Raster Stack in R

In the 
<a href="/hsi-hdf5-r" target="_blank">previous activity</a>, 
we exported a subset of the NEON Reflectance data from a HDF5 file. In this 
activity, we will create a full color image using 3 (red, green and blue - RGB) 
bands. We will follow many of the steps we followed in the 
<a href="/hsi-hdf5-r" target="_blank">Intro to Working with Hyperspectral Data tutorial</a>. 
These steps included loading required packages, reading in our file and viewing 
the file structure.

```{r load-libraries}

# Load required packages
library(raster)
library(rhdf5)
#library(rgdal)
#library(maps)

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where
# we want to save our files. Be sure to move the download into your working directory!
wd="~/Desktop/Hyperspectral_Tutorial/" #This will depend on your local environment
setwd(wd)

```

```{r read-in-file }

# Read in H5 file
#f <- paste0(wd,"NEONDSImagingSpectrometerData.h5")
f <- paste0(wd,"NEON_D17_SJER_DP3_257000_4112000_reflectance.h5")
#View HDF5 file structure 
h5ls(f,all=T)

```

To spatially locate our raster data, we need a few key attributes:

* The coordinate reference system
* The lower left hand corner X, Y location of the raster
* The dimensions (number of pixels in the x and y directions) of the raster to 
   use to calculate the **extent**.
   
We'll begin by grabbing these key attributes from the H5 file.   

```{r get-spatial-attributes }

# define coordinate reference system
myEPSG <- h5read(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Coordinate_System/EPSG Code" )
myCRS <- crs(paste0("+init=epsg:",myEPSG))

# define the resolution
reflInfo <- h5readAttributes(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data" )
resolution <- reflInfo$Spatial_Resolution_X_Y[1]

#grab the no data value
myNoDataValue <- reflInfo$Data_Ignore_Value
myNoDataValue

# Grab the UTM coordinates of the spatial extent

xMin <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[1]
xMax <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[2]
yMin <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[3]
yMax <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[4]

# define the extent (left, right, top, bottom)
rasExt <- extent(xMin,xMax,yMin,yMax)

rasExt

```

Next, we'll write a function that will perform the processing that we did step by 
step in the 
<a href="/hsi-hdf5-r" target="_blank">intro to working with hyperspectral data activity</a>.
This will allow us to process multiple bands in bulk.

The function `band2Rast` slices a band of data from the HDF5 file, and
extracts the reflectance. It them converts the data to a matrix, converts it to
a raster and returns a spatially corrected raster for the specified band. 

The function requires the following variables:

* file: the file
* band: the band number we wish to extract
* noDataValue: the noDataValue for the raster
* extent: a raster `Extent` object .
* res: the resolution of the raster
* crs: the Coordinate Reference System for the raster

The function output is a spatially referenced, R raster object.

```{r function-read-refl-data }

# file: the hdf file
# band: the band you want to process
# returns: a matrix containing the reflectance data for the specific band

band2Raster <- function(file, band, noDataValue, extent, CRS){
    #first read in the raster
    out<- h5read(file,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data",index=list(band,NULL,NULL))
	  #Convert from array to matrix
	  out <- (out[1,,])
	  #transpose data to fix flipped row and column order 
    #depending upon how your data are formatted you might not have to perform this
    #step.
	  out <-t(out)
    #assign data ignore values to NA
    #note, you might chose to assign values of 15000 to NA
    out[out == myNoDataValue] <- NA
	  
    #turn the out object into a raster
    outr <- raster(out,crs=CRS)
   
    #assign the extents to the raster
    extent(outr) <- extent
   
    #return the raster object
    return(outr)
}

```


Now that the function is created, we can create our list of rasters. The list 
specifies which bands (or dimensions in our hyperspectral dataset) we want to 
include in our raster stack. Let's start with a typical RGB (red, green, blue) 
combination. We will use bands 58, 34, and 19. 

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**Data Tip - wavelengths and bands:** Remember that 
you can look at the wavelengths dataset to determine the center wavelength value 
for each band. 
</div>


```{r create-raster-stack }
#create a list of the bands we want in our stack
rgb <- list(58,34,19)
#lapply tells R to apply the function to each element in the list
rgb_rast <- lapply(rgb,FUN=band2Raster, file = f,
                   noDataValue=myNoDataValue, 
                   extent=rasExt,
                   CRS=myCRS)

#check out the properties or rgb_rast
#note that it displays properties of 3 rasters.

rgb_rast

#finally, create a raster stack from our list of rasters
hsiStack <- stack(rgb_rast)

```

In the code chunk above, we used the `lapply()` function, which is a powerful,
flexible way to apply a function (in this case, our `band2Raster()` fucntion)
multiple times. You can <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/using-apply-sapply-lapply-in-r/" target="_blank">learn more about lapply() here</a>. 

NOTE: We are using the `raster stack` object in R to store several rasters that 
are of the same CRS and extent. This is a popular and convenient way to organize 
co-incident rasters.

Next, add the names of the bands to the raster so we can easily keep track of 
the bands in the list.

```{r plot-raster-stack }

#Add the band numbers as names to each raster in the raster list

#Create a list of band names
bandNames <- paste("Band_",unlist(rgb),sep="")

names(hsiStack) <- bandNames
#check properties of the raster list - note the band names
hsiStack

#scale the data as specified in the reflInfo$Scale Factor

hsiStack <- hsiStack/reflInfo$Scale_Factor

### Plot one raster in the stack to make sure things look OK.
plot(hsiStack$Band_58, main="Band 58")

	
```

We can play with the color ramps too if we want:

```{r plot-HSI-raster}

#change the colors of our raster 
myCol=terrain.colors(25)
image(hsiStack$Band_58, main="Band 58", col=myCol)

#adjust the zlims or the stretch of the image
myCol=terrain.colors(25)
image(hsiStack$Band_58, main="Band 58", col=myCol, zlim = c(0,.5))

#try a different color palette
myCol=topo.colors(15, alpha = 1)
image(hsiStack$Band_58, main="Band 58", col=myCol, zlim=c(0,.5))

```


The `plotRGB` function allows you to combine three bands to create an image. 


```{r plot-RGB-Image}


# create a 3 band RGB image
plotRGB(hsiStack,
        r=1,g=2,b=3, scale=300, 
        stretch = "Lin")

```

<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**A note about image stretching:** 
Notice that the scale is set to 300 on the RGB image that we plotted above. We 
can adjust this number and notice that the image gets darker - or lighter.

Once you've created your raster, you can export it as a GeoTIFF. You can bring 
this GeoTIFF into any GIS program!

```{r save-raster-geotiff}

# write out final raster	
# note: if you set overwrite to TRUE, then you will overwite or lose the older
# version of the tif file! keep this in mind.
writeRaster(hsiStack, file=paste0(wd,"rgbImage.tif"), format="GTiff", overwrite=TRUE)

```

### Challenge: Other band combinations

Use different band combinations to create other "RGB" images. Suggested band 
combinations are below: 

* Color Infrared/False Color: rgb (90,34,19)
* SWIR, NIR, Red Band: rgb (152,90,58)
* False Color: rgb (363,246,55)

## Raster Math - Creating NDVI and other Vegetation Indices in R
In this last part, we will calculate some vegetation indices using raster math 
in R! We will start by creating NDVI or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. 

### About NDVI

NDVI is  a ratio between 
the near infrared (NIR) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and the red 
portion of the spectrum. Please keep in mind that there are different ways to 
aggregate bands when using hyperspectral data. This example is using individual 
bands to perform the NDVI calculation. Using individual bands is not necessarily 
the best way to calculate NDVI from hyperspectral data! 

```{r create-NDVI }

#Calculate NDVI
#select bands to use in calculation (red, NIR)
ndvi_bands <- c(58,90)


#create raster list and then a stack using those two bands


ndvi_rast <- lapply(ndvi_bands,FUN=band2Raster, file = f,
                   noDataValue=myNoDataValue, 
                   extent=rasExt, CRS=myCRS)
ndvi_stack <- stack(ndvi_rast)

#make the names pretty
bandNDVINames <- paste("Band_",unlist(ndvi_bands),sep="")
names(ndvi_stack) <- bandNDVINames

ndvi_stack

#calculate NDVI
NDVI <- function(x) {
	  (x[,2]-x[,1])/(x[,2]+x[,1])
}
ndvi_calc <- calc(ndvi_stack,NDVI)
plot(ndvi_calc, main="NDVI for the NEON SJER Field Site")

#play with breaks and colors to create a meaningful map

#add a color map with 5 colors
myCol <- topo.colors(3)
#add breaks to the colormap, including lowest and highest values (4 breaks = 3 segments)
brk <- c(.9, .7, .4, 0)

#plot the image using breaks
plot(ndvi_calc, main="NDVI for the NEON SJER Field Site", col=myCol, breaks=brk)

```



	
<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
### Challenge: Work with Indices

Try the following:

1. Calculate EVI using the following formula : 
EVI<- 2.5 * ((b4-b3) / (b4 + 6 * b3- 7.5*b1 + 1))
2. Calculate NDNI using the following equation: 
log(1/p1510)-log(1/p1680)/ log(1/p1510)+log(1/p1680)
3. Explore the bands in the hyperspectral data. What happens if you average 
reflectance values across multiple red and NIR bands and then calculate NDVI?
