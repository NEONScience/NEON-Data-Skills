We will make calls to the 'sites/' and 'products/' endpoints of the API to determine availability of data for specific sites and months, and make a call to the 'data/' endpoint to learn the names and URLs of specific data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API is an [*Application Programming Interface*](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/api-call/); this is a system that allows programs to send instructions and requests to servers, typically recieving data in exchange. Whereas sending a URL over the web normally would cause a web page to be displayed, sending an API call URL results in the deisred data being directly downloaded to your computer. NEON provides an API that allows different programming languages to send requests for NEON data files and products.\n",

    "\n",
    "The actual API call takes the form of a web URL, the contents of which determine what data is returned. This URL can be broken down into three parts, which appear in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **base url** is the location of the server storing the data. This will be the same for all NEON API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **endpoint** indicates what type of data or metadata we are looking to download. This tutorial covers three endpoints: *sites/*, *products/*, and *data/*; other endpoints will be covered in later tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **target** is a value or series of values that indicate the specific data product, site, location, or data files we are looking up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In python we can easily deal with the complexities of the API call with by creating the different parts of the request as strings, then combining them with string concatenation. Concatenating (combining end to end) string in python is as easy as using a '+' sign. This approach makes it easy to modify different parts of our request as needed.\n",

    "NEON manages 81 different sites across the United States and Puerto Rico. These sites are separated into two main groups, terrestrial and aquatic, and the aquatic sites are further subdivided into lakes, rivers, and wadable streams. Each of these different site types has a different set of instrumentation and observation strategies, therefore, not every data product is available at every site. Often we begin by asking what kinds of data products are available for a given site. This is done by using the *sites/* endpoint in the API; this endpoint is used for getting information about specific NEON field sites. In this example we will query which data products are available at the <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/TEAK\" target=\"_blank\">Lower Teakettle (TEAK)</a> site."
