# In this tutorial we will learn to make calls to the NEON API using Python. We will make calls to the 'sites/' and 'products/' endpoints of the API to determine availability of data for specific sites and months, and make a call to the 'data/' endpoint to learn the names and URLs of specific data files.
# 
# An API is an [*Application Programming Interface*](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/api-call/); this is a system that allows programs to send instructions and requests to servers, typically recieving data in exchange. Whereas sending a URL over the web normally would cause a web page to be displayed, sending an API call URL results in the deisred data being directly downloaded to your computer. NEON provides an API that allows different programming languages to send requests for NEON data files and products.
# 
# In this tutorial we will cover how to use API calls to learn about what types of NEON data products are available for different sites and time periods.

# ## Basic API Call Components
# 
# The actual API call takes the form of a web URL, the contents of which determine what data is returned. This URL can be broken down into three parts, which appear in order:
# 
# - The **base url** is the location of the server storing the data. This will be the same for all NEON API calls.
# 
# - The **endpoint** indicates what type of data or metadata we are looking to download. This tutorial covers three endpoints: *sites/*, *products/*, and *data/*; other endpoints will be covered in later tutorials.
# 
# - The **target** is a value or series of values that indicate the specific data product, site, location, or data files we are looking up.
# 
# 
# 
# In python we can easily deal with the complexities of the API call with by creating the different parts of the request as strings, then combining them with string concatenation. Concatenating (combining end to end) string in python is as easy as using a '+' sign. This approach makes it easy to modify different parts of our request as needed.

import requests
import json


# In[2]:


#Every request begins with the server's URL
SERVER = 'http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/'


# ## Site Querying
# 
# NEON manages 81 different sites across the United States and Puerto Rico. These sites are separated into two main groups, terrestrial and aquatic, and the aquatic sites are further subdivided into lakes, rivers, and wadable streams. Each of these different site types has a different set of instrumentation and observation strategies, therefore, not every data product is available at every site. Often we begin by asking what kinds of data products are available for a given site. This is done by using the *sites/* endpoint in the API; this endpoint is used for getting information about specific NEON field sites. In this example we will query which data products are available at the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/TEAK" target="_blank">Lower Teakettle (TEAK)</a> site.

# In[3]:


#Site Code for Lower Teakettle
SITECODE = 'TEAK'


# We first use the requests module to send the API request using the 'get' function; this returns a 'request' object.
# To more easily access the data returned by the request, we convert the request object into a Python JSON object.

# In[4]:


#Make request, using the sites/ endpoint
site_request = requests.get(SERVER+'sites/'+SITECODE)

#Convert to Python JSON object
site_json = site_request.json()


# The JSON object in Python is a complex collection, with nested layers of dictionaries ('dicts') and lists. 
# 
# Briefly, a list is a collection of data in which each element is identified by index number, while a dictionary is a collection in which each element is identified by a label (called a 'key') that is usually a text string. You can visit the [w3schools website](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp) for more information on lists, and the [realpython website](https://realpython.com/python-dicts/) for more information on dictionaries. 
# 
# Dictionaries are defined using curly brackets ({...}) and lists are defined using square brackets (\[...\]). When we look at the request in JSON format, we can see this this is quite a lot of text arranged in nested dicts and lists:

# In[5]:


site_json


# At the uppermost level the JSON object is a dictionary containing a single element with the label 'data'. This 'data' element in turn contains a dictionary with elements containing various pieces of information about the site. When we want to know what elements a dict contians, we can use the *.keys()* method to list the keys to each element in that dict.

# In[6]:


#Use the 'keys' method to view the component of the uppermost json dictionary
site_json.keys()


# This output shows that the entire API response is contained within a single dict called 'data'. In order to access any of the information contained within this highest-level 'data' dict, we will need to reference that dict directly. Let's view the different keys that are available within 'data':

# In[7]:


#Access the 'data' component, and use the 'keys' method to view to componenets of the json data dictionary
site_json['data'].keys()


# The returned JSON keys includes information on site location, site type, site name and code, and the availability of different data products for the site. This last piece of information is located in the element with the 'dataProducts' key.
# 
# The 'dataProducts' element is a list of dictionaries, one for each type of NEON data product available at the site; each of these dictionaries has the same keys, but different values. Let's look at the JSON for the first entry ("\[0\]") in the list of data products:

# In[8]:


#View the first data product dictionary
site_json['data']['dataProducts'][0]


# Lists are a type of sequential data, so we can use Python's *for* loop to directly go through every element one by one, in this case to print out the data product code and data product name.

# In[9]:


#View product code and name for every available data product
for product in site_json['data']['dataProducts']:
    print(product['dataProductCode'],product['dataProductTitle'])


# Typically, we use site queries to determine for which months a particular data product is available at a particular site. Let's look for the availability of Breeding Landbird Counts (DP1.10003.001)

# In[10]:


#Look at Breeding Landbird Count data products
PRODUCTCODE = 'DP1.10003.001'


# For each data product, there will be a list of the months for which data of that type was collected and it available at the site, and a corresponding list with the URLs that we would put into the API to get data on that month of data products.

# In[11]:


#Get available months of Breeding Landbird Count data products for TEAK site
#Loop through the 'dataProducts' list items (each one a dict) at the site
for product in site_json['data']['dataProducts']: 
    if(product['dataProductCode'] == PRODUCTCODE): #If a list item's 'dataProductCode' dict element equals the product code string,
        print('Available Months: ',product['availableMonths']) #print the available months and URLs
        print('URLs for each Month: ', product['availableDataUrls'])


# ## Data Product Querying
# 
# Alternatively, we may want a specific type of data product, but aren't certain of the sites and months for which that data is available. In this case we can use the product code and the *products/* API endpoint to look up availbility.

# In[12]:


#Make request
product_request = requests.get(SERVER+'products/'+PRODUCTCODE)
product_json = product_request.json()


# The product JSON will again store everything first in a 'data' element. Within this container, the product data is a dictionary with information on the data product we are looking up.

# In[13]:


#Print keys for product data dictionary
print(product_json['data'].keys())


# This request returned a lot of different types of information. Much of this information is meant to provide explanations and context for the data product. Let's look at the abstract, which provides a relatively brief description of the data product.

# In[14]:


#Print code, name, and abstract of data product
print(product_json['data']['productCode'])
print(product_json['data']['productName'])
print()
print(product_json['data']['productAbstract'])


# 
# For looking up the availability of the data product, we want the 'siteCodes' element. This is a list with an entry for each site at which the data product is available. Each site entry is a dict whose elements includes site code, a list of months for which data is available, and a list of the API request URLs to request data for that site for a given month.

# In[15]:


#View keys of one site dictionary
print(product_json['data']['siteCodes'][0].keys())


# We can look up the availability of data at a particular site, and get a URL to request data for a specific month. We know from earlier that Lower Teakettle (TEAK) has the data product we want for June 2018; we can get the URL needed to request that data with nested loops through site and month lists.

# In[16]:


#View available months and corresponding API urls, then save desired URL
for site in product_json['data']['siteCodes']:
    if(site['siteCode'] == SITECODE):
        for month in zip(site['availableMonths'],site['availableDataUrls']): #Loop through the list of months and URLs
            print(month[0],month[1]) 
            if(month[0] == '2018-06'): #If data is available for the desired month, save the URL
                data_url = month[1]
    


# In[17]:


print(data_url)


# ## Data File Querying
# 
# We now know that landbird count data products are available for 2018-06 at the Lower Teakettle site. Using the server url, site code, product code, and a year-month argument, we can make a request to the *data/* endpoint of the NEON API. This will allow us to see what specific landbird count data files can be obtained for 2018-06 at the Lower Teakettle site, and to learn the locations of these files as URLs.

# In[18]:


#Make Request
data_request = requests.get(SERVER+'data/'+PRODUCTCODE+'/'+SITECODE+'/'+'2018-06')
data_json = data_request.json()


# Alternatively we could use one of the "Available Data URLs" from a *sites/* or *products/* request, like the data_url we saved earlier.

# In[19]:


#Make request with saved url
data_request = requests.get(data_url)
data_json = data_request.json()


# In[20]:


#Print dict key for 'data' element of data JSON
print(data_json['data'].keys())


# As with the sites JSON content, the uppermost level of a data request JSON object is a dictionary whose only member has the 'data' key; this member in turn is a dictionary with the product code, the sitecode, the month, and a list of the available data files.
# 
# The 'files' list is a list of python dictionaries, one for each file available based on our query; the dictionary for each file includes an internal reference code, the file name, the size of the file in bytes, and the url at which the file is located.

# In[21]:


#View keys and values in first file dict
for key in data_json['data']['files'][0].keys(): #Loop through keys of the data file dict
    print(key,':\t', data_json['data']['files'][0][key])


# In[22]:


for file in data_json['data']['files']:
    print(file['name'])


# A number of different files are available, but the actual count data are in files which have 'brd_perpoint' or 'brd_countdata' in the file name. 
# 
# We can use *if* statements to get info on only these files. The Python **in** operator, in addition to being part of the construction of for loops, can check if a particular value is present in a sequence, so it can check if a particular series of characters is present in a string.

# In[23]:


for file in data_json['data']['files']:
    if(('_perpoint' in file['name'])|('_countdata' in file['name'])): #if file name includes '_perpoint' or '_countdata'
        print(file['name'],file['url'])


# We can download the desired files by simply going to the obtained URLs in any browser. However, we might want the Python script to download the files for us. Alternatively, depending on the type of file, various funcitons exist that could read data from the file directly into Python. We'll dicuss this, along with how to identify which file we want, in the next tutorial.
