### Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Open NEON AOP HDF5 files using a function
* Batch process several HDF5 files
* Complete relative comparisons between several imaging spectrometer observations of the same target from different view angles 
* Error check the data. 

### Install Python Packages

* **numpy**

### Download Data

To complete this tutorial, you will use data available from the NEON 2017 Data
Institute teaching dataset available for download. 

This tutorial will use the files contained in the 'F07A' Directory in <a href="https://neondata.sharefile.com/share/view/cdc8242e24ad4517/fo0c2f24-c7d2-4c77-b297-015366afa9f4" target="_blank">this ShareFile Directory</a>. You will want to download the entire directory as a single ZIP file, then extract that file into a location where you store your data.

<a href="https://neondata.sharefile.com/share/view/cdc8242e24ad4517/fo0c2f24-c7d2-4c77-b297-015366afa9f4" class="link--button link--arrow">
Download Dataset</a>

Caution: This dataset includes all the data for the 2017 Data Institute, 
including hyperspectral and lidar datasets and is therefore a large file (12 GB). 
Ensure that you have sufficient space on your 
hard drive before you begin the download. If not, download to an external 
hard drive and make sure to correct for the change in file path when working 
through the tutorial.

The LiDAR and imagery data used to create this raster teaching data subset 
were collected over the 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/" target="_blank"> National Ecological Observatory Network's</a> 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/field-sites/" target="_blank" >field sites</a>
and processed at NEON headquarters.
The entire dataset can be accessed on the 
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org" target="_blank"> NEON data portal</a>.

These data are a part of the NEON 2017 Remote Sensing Data Institute. The complete archive may be found here -<a href="https://neondata.sharefile.com/d-s11d5c8b9c53426db"> NEON Teaching Data Subset: Data Institute 2017 Data Set</a>

The NEON AOP has flown several special flight plans called BRDF 
(bi-directional reflectance distribution function) flights. These flights were 
designed to quantify the the effect of observing targets from a variety of 
different look-angles, and with varying surface roughness. This allows an 
assessment of the sensitivity of the NEON imaging spectrometer (NIS) results to these paraemters. THe BRDF 
flight plan takes the form of a star pattern with repeating overlapping flight 
lines in each direction. In the center of the pattern is an area where nearly 
all the flight lines overlap. This area allows us to retrieve a reflectance 
curve of the same targat from the many different flight lines to visualize 
how then change for each acquisition. The following figure displays a BRDF 
flight plan as well as the number of flightlines (samples) which are 
overlapping.

To date (June 2017), the NEON AOP has flown a BRDF flight at SJER and SOAP (D17) and 
ORNL (D07). We will work with the ORNL BRDF flight and retrieve reflectance 
curves from up to 18 lines and compare them to visualize the differences in the 
resulting curves. To reduce the file size, each of the BRDF flight lines have 
been reduced to a rectangular area covering where all lines are overlapping, 
additionally several of the ancillary rasters normally included have been 
removed in order to reduce file size. 


We'll start off by again adding necessary libraries and our NEON AOP HDF5 reader 
function.

print('Starting BRDF Analysis')
```

    Starting BRDF Analysis


First we will define the extents of the rectangular array containing the section from each BRDF flightline. 


```python
BRDF_rectangle = np.array([[740315,3982265],[740928,3981839]],np.float)
```

Next we will define the coordinates of the target of interest. These can be set as any coordinate pait that falls within the rectangle above, therefore the coordaintes must be in UTM Zone 16 N.  


```python
x_coord = 740600
y_coord = 3982000
```

To prevent the function of failing, we will first check to ensure the coordinates are within the rectangular bounding box. If they are not, we throw an error message and exit from the script.


```python
if BRDF_rectangle[0,0] <= x_coord <= BRDF_rectangle[1,0] and BRDF_rectangle[1,1] <= y_coord <= BRDF_rectangle[0,1]:
    print('Point in bounding area')
    y_index = floor(x_coord - BRDF_rectangle[0,0])
    x_index = floor(BRDF_rectangle[0,1] - y_coord)
else:
    print('Point not in bounding area, exiting')
    raise Exception('exit')
```

    Point in bounding area


Now we will define the location of the all the subset NEON AOP h5 files from the BRDF flight


```python
## You will need to update this filepath for your local data directory
h5_directory = "/Users/olearyd/Git/data/F07A/"
```

Now we will grab all files / folders within the defined directory and then cycle through them and retain only the h5files


```python
files = os.listdir(h5_directory)
h5_files = [i for i in files if i.endswith('.h5')]
```

Now we will print the h5 files to make sure they have been included and set up a figure for plotting all of the reflectance curves


```python
print(h5_files)

fig=plt.figure()
ax = plt.subplot(111)
```

Now we will begin cycling through all of the h5 files and retrieving the information we need also print the file that is currently being processed

Inside the for loop we will

1) read in the reflectance data and the associated metadata, but construct the file name from the generated file list

2) Determine the indexes of the water vapor bands (bad band windows) in order to mask out all of the bad bands

3) Read in the reflectance dataset using the NEON AOP H5 reader function

4) Check the first value the first value of the reflectance curve (actually any value). If it is equivalent to the NO DATA value, then coordainte chosen did not intersect a pixel for the flight line. We will just continue and move to the next line.

5) Apply NaN values to the areas contianing the bad bands

6) Split the contents of the file name so we can get the line number for labelling in the plot.

7) Plot the curve




```python
for file in h5_files:

    print('Working on ' + file)
    
    [reflArray,metadata,wavelengths] = h5refl2array(h5_directory+file)
    bad_band_window1 = (metadata['bad_band_window1'])
    bad_band_window2 = (metadata['bad_band_window2'])

    index_bad_window1 = [i for i, x in enumerate(wavelengths) if x > bad_band_window1[0] and x < bad_band_window1[1]]
    index_bad_window2 = [i for i, x in enumerate(wavelengths) if x > bad_band_window2[0] and x < bad_band_window2[1]]
    
    index_bad_windows = index_bad_window1+index_bad_window2
    reflectance_curve = np.asarray(reflArray[y_index,x_index,:], dtype=np.float32)
    if reflectance_curve[0] == metadata['noDataVal']:
        continue
    reflectance_curve[index_bad_windows] = np.nan
    filename_split = (file).split("_") 
    ax.plot(wavelengths,reflectance_curve/metadata['scaleFactor'],label = filename_split[5]+' Reflectance')
```

This plots the reflectance curves from all lines onto the same plot. Now, we will add the appropriate legend and plot labels, display and save the plot with the coordaintes in the file name so we can repeat the position of the target


```python
box = ax.get_position()
ax.set_position([box.x0, box.y0, box.width * 0.8, box.height])
ax.legend(loc='center left',bbox_to_anchor=(1,0.5))
plt.title('BRDF Reflectance Curves at ' + str(x_coord) +' '+ str(y_coord))
plt.xlabel('Wavelength (nm)'); plt.ylabel('Refelctance (%)')
fig.savefig('BRDF_uncertainty_at_' + str(x_coord) +'_'+ str(y_coord)+'.png',dpi=500,orientation='landscape',bbox_inches='tight',pad_inches=0.1)
plt.show()
```

It is possible that the figure above does not display properly, which is why we use the `fig.save()` method above to store the resulting figure as its own PNG file in the same directory as this Jupyter Notebook file.

The result is a plot with all the curves in which we can visualize the difference in the observations simply by chaging the flight direction with repect to the ground target.

Experiment with changing the coordinates to analyze different targets within the rectangle.
