    "Canopy Nitrogen (Normalized Difference Nitrogen Index (NDNI)) was one of NEON's original data products, however the first algorithm used (a simple index) was deemed to provide data of insufficient quality for the sensor, scale and site conditions associated with NEON AOP collections. See the <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/impact/observatory-blog/upcoming-changes-aop-data-product-catalog\" target=_blank>November 17, 2020 Data Notification</a> for more details. Over the past years, AOP has been working on implementing an improved algorithm that produces higher quality results. In February 2025, NEON published a new Canopy Nitrogen (%N) data product (<a href=\"https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP3.30018.002\" target=_blank>DP3.30018.002</a>) for a subset of sites, using models derived from NEON's hyperspectral and foliar chemistry data. We are seeking feedback from the community to review this data product before the model is applied to all of NEON's terrestrial sites. For more details on the data product, refer to the Quick Start Guide on the Data Portal page.\n",

The \"non-needle\" class includes all vegetation types that are not needleleaf, such as broadleaf trees, shrubs, herbaceous cover, and others. Separate random forest regression models have been developed to predict foliar nitrogen values for needle and non-needle vegetation types.\n",
