    "This notebook demonstrates how to generate a training dataset consisting of tree species, family, and location from the NEON Terrestrial Observation System (TOS) Vegetation Structure data product <a href=\"https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10098.001\" target=_blank>DP1.10098.001</a>. We will use data from the <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/serc\" target=_blank>Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC)</a> site in Maryland. In a subsequent tutorial titled <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/refl-classification-pyxarray\" target=_blank>Tree Classification with NEON Airborne Imaging Spectrometer Data using Python xarray</a>, we will use this training dataset to train a random forest machine learning model that predicts tree families from the hyperspectral signatures obtained from the airborne remote sensing data. These two tutorials outline a relatively simple modeling example, and represent a starting point for conducting machine learning analyses using NEON data!\n",

    "### Set Up Python Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, you will need the following Python packages, which can be installed using `!pip install` or `!conda install` from within the notebook. Note that to use the `neonutilities` package, you will need Python version 3.9 or higher.\n",

    "### Create a NEON AOP Token\n",
    " - NEON API Token (optional, but strongly recommended), see [NEON API Tokens Tutorial](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neon-api-tokens-tutorial) for more details on how to create and set up your token in Python (and R). Once you create your token (on the [NEON User Accounts](https://www.neonscience.org/about/user-accounts)) page, this notebook will show you how to set it as an environment variable and use it for downloading AOP data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Use the `neonutilities` `load_by_product` function to read in NEON vegetation structure data at a given site\n",
    "- Use the NEON locations API to determine the geographic position of the vegetation records in UTM x, y coordinates\n",
    "- Filter the datset to include only the latest data and columns of interest\n",
    "- Filter the data geospatially to keep data that are within a single AOP 1 km x 1 km tile\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer**: this notebook is intended to provide an example of how to create an initial training data set for pairing with remote sensing data, and to conduct some exploratory analysis of the vegetation structure data. This does not incorporate outlier detection and removal, or comprehensive pre-processing steps. As part of creating a machine learning model, it is important to assess the training data quality and look for outliers or other potential data quality issues which may impact model results. Refer to the <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/tree-heights-veg-structure-chm\" target=_blank>Compare tree height measured from the ground to a Lidar-based Canopy Height Model</a> lesson (the first additional resource above) for more details on how you would address geographic mismatch between the AOP and TOS data.\n",

    "In this lesson, we have created a training data set containing information about the tree family and species as well as their geographic locations in UTM x, y coordinates. We can now pair this training data set with the remote sensing data and create a model to predict the tree's family based off airborne spectral data. The next tutorial, <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/refl-classification-pyxarray\" target=_blank>Tree Classification with NEON Airborne Imaging Spectrometer Data using Python xarray</a>, will show how to do this!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** you may wish to create a training dataframe that contains additional information about the trees. For example, you can also include parameters like the growth form (e.g. whether the vegetation is a shrub, single-bole or multi-bole tree, etc.), the plant status (whether the tree is healthy or standing dead), and measurements such as the stem diameter and tree height. To do this, you would need to join the `vst_mappingandtagging` table with the `vst_apparentindividual` tables. Refer to the <a href=\"https://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/quick-start-guides/NEON.QSG.DP1.00001.001v2?inline=TRUE\" target=_blank>Quick Start Guide for Vegetation Structure</a> for more information about the data tables and the joining instructions. You can also refer to the lesson <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/tree-heights-veg-structure-chm\" target=_blank>Compare tree height measured from the ground to a Lidar-based Canopy Height Model</a> which provides an example of how to do this and compare the TOS measured data with the AOP Lidar-derived Canopy Height Model (Ecosystem Structure) data product."
