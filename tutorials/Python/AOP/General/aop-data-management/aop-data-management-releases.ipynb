    "## What is a NEON Data Release?\n",
    "\n",
    "A NEON Data Release is a fixed set of data that does not change over time. Each data product in a Release is associated with a unique Digital Object Identifier (DOI) that can be used for data citation. Because the data in a Release do not change, analyses performed on those data are traceable and reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "NEON data are initially published under a Provisional status, meaning that data may be updated on an as-needed basis, without guarantee of reproducibility. Publishing Provisional data allows NEON to publish data rapidly while retaining the ability to make corrections or additions as the need is identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details about NEON Data Releases, see the <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/release-provisional-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Releases and Provisional Data</a> tutorial and the <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/data-management/data-revisions-releases\" target=\"_blank\">Data Product Revisions and Releases</a> web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How are AOP Releases different than the other NEON subsystems (IS/OS)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike NEON's other systems (IS and OS), AOP does not preserve historical versions of data. Most AOP data products are high volume; thus it is expensive to store and make openly and freely available more than the most recent version. Therefore, NEON's annual releases for AOP data products are only available for the current release year – from the date of release to approximately 11 months later when the AOP team begins preparing for the next year’s release. For example, Release-2022 versions of AOP data products were available from January 20, 2022 until mid-December 2022.    \n",
    "\n",
    "DOIs for AOP data products for a given RELEASE will be `tombstoned` prior to each subsequent Release. These tombstoned data can be thought of as being \"out of print\": the DOI for each data product release is still valid, but the version of the data that the DOI referred to is no longer available for download. A DOI that has been tombstoned will resolve to the data product release's webpage which explains that the released version of the product is no longer available for download (e.g. <a href=\"https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP3.30015.001/RELEASE-2023\" target=\"_blank\">Ecosystem structure RELEASE-2023</a>, also shown in the figure below). \n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "\t<a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/aop-general/2023_tombstoned_aop_chm_screenshot.png\">\n",
    "\t<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/aop-general/2023_tombstoned_aop_chm_screenshot.png\" alt=\"Example of a Tombstoned AOP Dataset.\" style=\"width:50%\" height=\"auto\"></a>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to each annual NEON Release, AOP scientists review the existing data and reprocess data if any issues are identified. Then they begin an approximately month-long transition period of replacing older files with newer ones. During this period, the current data release tag may no longer point to the same exact files for certain AOP data products that are undergoing updates. Although the data portal or API may indicate availability of a data product at specific sites for specific months, some files may be unavailable for few days (or longer) before being replaced by updated versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "NEON will publish a Data Notification indicating when AOP is transitioning between one Release and the next (e.g.,  <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/impact/observatory-blog/aop-data-availability-notification-release-2024\" target=\"_blank\">AOP Data Availability Notification – Release 2024</a>). We suggest holding off on downloading AOP data during this interim period if it is not urgent, or submitting a request through the NEON Contact Us form to obtain information about the status of the data product(s) you are interested in. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I tell if the AOP data I've downloaded is up to date?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to check if and what AOP data have been updated since you last downloaded the data, both on the website, and programmatically using functionality built into the AOP download functions. On the website, you can check the Issue Log tables on each data product page and also see the Issue resolutions, and you can also check the Release pages for a complete summary of what has been changed between the past release and the current one; for example <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/data-management/data-revisions-releases/release-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Release 2025</a>. This tutorial will demonstrate some of the programmatic options to check if published AOP data has been modified compared to your local version.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "After completing this activity, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Find available Released and Provisional AOP data for a given site and data product\n",
    " * Understand options for downloading AOP data\n",
    " * Display citation information for both Released and Provisional data\n",
    " * Learn about available tools to reduce large data downloads\n",
    " * Understand some basic best practices for working with large volumes of AOP data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Things You’ll Need To Complete This Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this tutorial, you will need a version of Python (3.9 or higher), the latest Python neonutilities package (1.2 or higher) and, preferably, Jupyter Notebooks or Spyder installed on your computer. Much of the lesson can also be carried out in R using the R neonUtilities package; however some of the functionality that is demonstrated is currently only available in Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we chose to demonstrate data downloads for a small site, and a relatively small AOP data product (comprised of single-band geotiff files). However, some of the other AOP datasets such as the surface reflectance data (426 bands) and the L1 discrete and waveform lidar data can be very large in size, especially for the typical 10 x 10 km terrestrial sites (or in some cases, larger)! If you are working with geotiff data for multiple years and sites, the data volume can also quickly add up. So what if you've already downloaded some AOP data and only want to pull data that has been updated, or make sure your data is up-to-date with the latest release? \n",
    "\n",
    "The latest version of Python `neonutilities`(1.2.0, released in October 2025, see <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/impact/observatory-blog/version-120-neonutilities-python-package-released\" target=\"_blank\">Version 1.2.0 of neonutilities Python package released</a>), has some options that allow you to skip downloading existing files with the `skip_if_exists` option, and as part of this, it will check the local files against the published files. We will now give an overview of this input, and the related `overwrite` input, which provides you some different options depending on your use-case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for the `skip_if_exists` option to work properly, some conditions must be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The locally downloaded data must be saved in the same location as it was originally downloaded, and you have to use the same `savepath` when you re-download the data.\n",
    "2. Data that was originally provisional (thus in the `neon-aop-provisional-products` bucket) and is now released will not be compared, since the bucket has changed. So if you are trying to download newly released data, we recommend deleting the provisional data folders and re-downloading the latest, which will ensure you have the latest released version. If you prefer to check your local data agains the released data, you could do this, but would have to re-name the provisional folder `neon-aop-provisional-products` to `neon-aop-products` in order for the checks to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go ahead and try out the `skip_if_exists` option. For now, we have just downloaded data from MCRA 2023 and 2025. Assuming you haven't changed anything in those download folders, if you set `skip_if_exists=True` (all else the same) the code should find that all the data are matching and there is no new data to download. Let's see!"

    "- The `skip_if_exists` option only looks for missing files or altered files. If there are additional files locally compared to what is published on the portal, the function will not do anything about those files. To be safe, deleting the local folder and running a fresh download is still the cleanest option to ensure you've downloaded the most recent data (and that you only have the most recent data) in your local folder. There are cases where AOP files are remove from one release to the next (such as files that were entirely NaN, for example).\n",
    "- When you are working with older data and use the `skip_if_exists` option to identify modified data, the release and citation information can get confusing. You can use the `list_available_dates` function to ensure you know whether the data are currently Released or Provisional.\n",
    "- If the data were originally provisionally published, and have been moved to a Release, the folder where they are downloaded will change, and the `skip_if_exists` option does not currently check against both folders.\n",

    "## AOP Release Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some of the most important points to remember about AOP Data Releases, and how they differ from the other NEON sub-systems (IS and OS).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Released Data\n",
    "- Unlike IS and OS data, older AOP data releases are not saved indefinitely. Only the latest years' release is saved.\n",
    "- Each January when a new release becomes available, the AOP data from the last year's release is \"`tombstoned`\". The DOIs for older releases are still valid, but the data from those releases become out-of-print, and the same exact dataset may no longer be accessible.\n",
    "- The summary of what has been changed from one year to the next is available on the Release page, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/data-management/data-revisions-releases/release-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Release 2025</a>.\n",
    "- Issue logs for each data product are also provided on the Data Portal product pages, and these logs are downloaded by default as part of the `neonutilities` download functions. Issue logs should be reviewed to ensure the data you are working with do not currently have any known issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Provisional Data\n",
    "- Provisional data may be updated at any time and therefore do not have a static DOI. These data can still be (and should be) cited.\n",
    "- There is typically a 1-year lag period before newly published data are released (so data collected in 2024 would not be available in a release until early 2026). This lag period may be longer in some cases, for example if AOP is providing a major algorithm update.\n",
    "- For AOP data, whether you are using released or provisional data, if you need your results to be fully reproducible, you will need to archive the AOP data that you used. See the Large Data Packages section on the <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/guidelines-policies/publishing-research-outputs\" target=\"_blank\">Publishing Research Outputs</a> page for suggestions about archiving large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AOP Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provided a quick overview of downloading AOP data in Python and some different options for downloading and checking for updated data, if you have already downloaded AOP data locally and don't want to re-download large volumes of data. To sum up, below are a few considerations and best practices that we recommend when working with AOP data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `skip_if_exists` option and optionally the `overwrite` option to check for (and download) any missing or modified files.\n",
    "- Pay attention to whether the data are provisional or released when you first download the data, and when you attempt to re-download data. The root folder where the data are downloaded may have changed from `neon-aop-provisional-products` to `neon-aop-products`.\n",
    "- There are multiple options for citing data, either on the Data Product page, in the downloaded citation file, or using the `neonutilities` `get_citation` function. Please use this when you first download the data, and update accordingly if data has since been released (and you have overwritten data with the most recent version).\n",
    "- If you want to work with the latest data and ensure everything is up to date, the cleanest option is to delete any pre-existing folders and re-download, as the `skip_if_exists` does not handle every possible scenario (for example if you have additional files locally that are not published).\n",
    "- Finally, a subset of the Level 3 (tiled) AOP data are also available on Google Earth Engine (GEE). The release information for those data is contained in the Properties under the `PROVISIONAL_RELEASE` and `RELEASE_YEAR` tags. There will be a short (less than a month) lag between when data are Released on the Data Portal and when data on GEE are updated to pull in the latest released data. GEE does not require downloading any data and has many built-in algorithms for cloud-processing of remote sensing data, so this is a good alternative if you want to avoid local storage and compute. Please refer to the <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/intro-aop-data-google-earth-engine-gee-tutorial-series\" target=\"_blank\">Intro to AOP Data in Google Earth Engine (GEE) Tutorial Series</a> to get started working with AOP data in GEE. You can also work with the data in GEE using Python, for example as shown in the tutorial <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/aop-gee-py-intro\" target=\"_blank\">Intro to AOP Datasets in Google Earth Engine (GEE) using Python</a>.\n"
