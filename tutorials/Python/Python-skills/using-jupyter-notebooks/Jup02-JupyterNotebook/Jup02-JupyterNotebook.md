## Setting up Jupyter Notebooks

You can set up your notebook in several ways. Here we present the Anaconda Python
distribution method so as to follow the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/setup-git-bash-python" target="_blank">Data Institute set up instructions</a>. 

### Browser
First, make sure you have an updated browser on which to run the app. Both Mozilla
Firefox and Google Chrome work well.  

### Installation 
Data Institute participants should have already installed Jupyter Notebooks 
through the Anaconda installation during the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/setup-git-bash-python" target="_blank">Data Institute set up instructions</a>.

If you install Python using `pip` you can install the Jupyter package with the 
following code. 

<pre><code> 
# Python2
pip install jupyter
# Python 3
pip3 install jupyter
</code></pre>


## Set up Environment 

We need to set up the Python environment that we will be working in for the Notebook.
This allows us to have different Python environments for different projects. The
following directions pertain directly to the set up for the 2018 Data Institute 
on Remote Sensing with Reproducible Workflows, however, you can adapt them to 
the specific Python version and packages you wish to work with.  

If you haven't yet created a Python 3.8 environment (released October 2019), you'll need to do 
that now. You can use the single line provided below, or refer back to the Python section of the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/setup-git-bash-python" target="_blank">installation instructions</a>, 
for more details. To create this Python 3.8 environment, you must first install Anaconda Navigator onto your computer, then open the Anaconda Prompt application (or your terminal) and type the following into the prompt window:

`conda create -n p38 python=3.8 anaconda`

And activate the Python 3.8 environment:

On Mac:

`source activate p38`

On Windows:

`activate p38`


In the terminal application, navigate to the directory (`cd`)  where you
want the Jupyter Notebooks to be saved (or where they already exist). 

Once here, we want to create a new Jupyter kernel for the Python 3.8 conda environment 
(p38) that we'll be using with Jupyter Notebooks. 

With the p38 environment activated, in your Command Prompt/Terminal, type: 

`python -m ipykernel install --user --name p38 --display-name "Python 3.8 NEON-RSDI"`

This command tells Python to create a new ipy (aka Jupyter Notebook) kernel using
the Python environment we set up and called "p38". Then we tell it to use the display
name for this new kernel as "Python 3.8 NEON-RSDI". You will use this 
name to identify the specific kernel you want to work with in the Notebook space, 
so name it descriptively, especially if you think you'll be using several different 
kernels.  


## Using Jupyter Notebooks

### Launching the Application 

To launch the application either launch it from the Anaconda Navigator or by 
typing `jupyter notebook` into your terminal or command window. 

<pre><code> 
# Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook
</code></pre>

More information can be found in the **Read the Docs** 
<a href="https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html" target="_blank"> Running the Jupyter Notebook</a>. 

### Navigating the Jupyter Python Interface

*The following information is adapted from Griffin Chure's <a href="http://bi1.caltech.edu/code/t0b_jupyter_notebooks.html" target="_blank"> Tutorial 0b: Using Jupyter Notebooks</a>*

If everything launched correctly, you should be able to see a screen which looks 
something like this.  Note that the home directory will be whatever directory you
have navigated to in your terminal before launching Jupyter Notebooks.

</figure>

To start a new Python notebook, click on the right-hand side of the application 
window and select `New` (the expanded menu is shown in the screen shot above). 
This will give you several options for new notebook kernels depending on what
is installed on your computer. In the above screenshot, there are two available 
Python kernels and one Matlab kernel. When starting a notebook, you should choose 
`Python 3` if it is available or `conda(root)` . 

Once you start a new notebook, you will be brought to the following screen.

Welcome to your first look at a Jupyter notebook! 

There are many available buttons for you to click. The three most important 
components of the notebook are highlighted in colored boxes. 

* In **blue** is the **name** of the notebook. By clicking this, you can rename 
the notebook. 
* In **red** is the **cell formatting assignment**. By default, it is registered 
as code, but it can also be set to markdown as described later.
* In **purple**, is the **code cell**. In this cell, you can type an execute 
Python code as well as text that will be formatted in a nicely readable format.

## Selecting a Kernel

A kernel is a server that enables you to run commands within Jupyter Notebook. It is visible via a prompt window that logs all your actions in the notebook, making it helpful to refer to when encountering errors. You'll be prompted to select a kernel when you open a new notebook, however, if 
you are opening an existing notebook you will want to ensure that you are 
using the correct kernel. The commands for selecting and changing kernels are in 
the **Kernel** menu. 

When you select or switch a kernel, you may want to use the navigate to **Kernel** in the menu, 
select **Restart/ClearOutlook**.  The Restart/ClearOutlook option ensures that 
the correct kernel will operate.

You can always check what version of Python you are running by typing the following 
into a code cell. 

	 # Check what version of Python.  Should be 3.5. 
	 import sys
	 sys.version


## Writing & running code

*The following information is adapted from Griffin Chure's <a href="http://bi1.caltech.edu/code/t0b_jupyter_notebooks.html" target="_blank"> Tutorial 0b: Using Jupyter Notebooks</a>*

All code you write in the notebook will be in the code cell. You can write 
single lines, to entire loops, to complete functions. As an example, we can 
write and evaluate a print statement in a code cell, as is shown below. 

If you would like to write several lines of code, hit `Enter` to continue entering code into another line. To execute the code, we can simply hit `Shift + Enter` while our cursor is in the 
code cell.

	 # This is a comment and is not read by Python
	 print('Hello! This is the print function. Python will print this line below')

	 Hello! This is the print function. Python will print this line below

We can also write a 'for' loop as an example of executing multiple lines of code at once.

	 # Write a basic for loop. In this case a range of numbers 0-4.
	 for i in range(5):
    # Multiply the value of i by two and assign it to a variable. 
    temp_variable = 2 * i

    # Print the value of the temp variable.
    print(temp_variable)

	 0
	 2
	 4
	 6
	 8


There are two other useful keyboard shortcuts for running code:

* `Alt + Enter` runs the current cell and inserts a new one below
* `Ctrl + Enter` run the current cell and enters command mode.

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**  Code cells can be executed in any 
order. This means that you can overwrite your current variables by running 
things out of order. When coding in notebooks, be cautious of the order in 
which you run cells.

If you would like more details on running code in Jupyter Notebooks, please go through the 
following short tutorial by 
<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.ipynb" target="_blank"> Running Code </a> 
by contributors to the Jupyter project. This tutorial touches on start and stopping 
the kernel and using multiple kernels (e.g., Python and R) in one notebook. 

## Writing Text

*The following information is adapted from Griffin Chure's <a href="http://bi1.caltech.edu/code/t0b_jupyter_notebooks.html" target="_blank"> Tutorial 0b: Using Jupyter Notebooks</a>*

Arguably the most useful component of the Jupyter Notebook is the ability to 
interweave code and explanatory text into a single, coherent document. Through
out the Data Institute (and one's everyday workflow), we encourage all code and 
plots should be accompanied with explanatory text. 

Each cell in a notebook can exist either as a code cell or as a text-formatting 
cell called a markdown cell. Markdown is a mark-up language that very easily 
converts to other type-setting formats such as HTML and PDF. 

Whenever you make a new cell, its default assignment will be a code cell. 
This means when you want to write text, you will need to specifically change it 
to a markdown cell. You can do this by clicking on the drop-down menu that reads code' 
(highlighted in red in the second figure of this page) and selecting 'Markdown'. 
You can then type in the code cell and all Python syntax highlighting will be 
removed.

## Saving & Quitting

*The following information is adapted from Griffin Chure's <a href="http://bi1.caltech.edu/code/t0b_jupyter_notebooks.html" target="_blank"> Tutorial 0b: Using Jupyter Notebooks</a>*

Jupyter notebooks are set up to autosave your work every 15 or so minutes. 
However, you should not rely on the autosave feature! Save your work frequently 
by clicking on the floppy disk icon located in the upper left-hand corner of the 
toolbar.

To navigate back to the root of your Jupyter notebook server, you can click on 
the Jupyter logo at any time.

To quit your Jupyter notebook, you can simply close the browser window and the 
Jupyter notebook server running in your terminal. 

## Converting to HTML and PDF

In addition to sharing notebooks in the.ipynb format, it may useful to convert 
these notebooks to highly-portable formats such as HTML and PDF.

To convert, you can either use the dropdown menu option 

File -> download as -> ... 

or via the command line by using the following lines:

	 jupyter nbconvert --to pdf notebook_name.ipynb 

Where "notebook_name.ipynb" matches the name of the notebook you want to convert. Prior to 
converting the notebook, you must be in the same working directory as your notebook or use
the correct file path from your current working directory. 

Converting to PDF requires both Pandoc and LaTeX to be installed. You can find 
out more in the <a href="https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#" target="_blank">ReadTheDoc for nbconvert</a>. 

If you prefer to convert to a different format, like HTML, you simply change the 
file type. 
	 jupyter nbconvert --to html notebook_name.ipynb
