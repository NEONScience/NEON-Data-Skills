In this tutorial we learn how to effectively and efficiently document and publish our
workflows online.

<div id="ds-objectives" markdown="1">

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Explain why documenting and publishing one's code is important.
* Describe two tools that enable ease of publishing code & output: Jupyter Notebooks
with the Python kernel.

## Documentation Is Important

As we read in
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/rep-sci-intro" target="_blank"> the Reproducible Science overview</a>,
the four facets of reproducible science are:

* Documentation
* Organization
* Automation and
* Dissemination.

This week we will learn about the Jupyter Notebook as a tool to document and 
publish (disseminate) your code and code output.

## Jupyter Notebook  

> â€œThe Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to 
create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and 
explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical 
simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more."
-- <a href="http://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebook documentation</a>.

We use markdown syntax in Notebook documents to document workflows and
to share data processing, analysis and visualization outputs. We can also use it
to create documents that combine code in your language of choice, output and text.  

The Jupyter Notebooks grew out of iPython. *Jupyter* is a close acronym meaning 
Julia, Python, and R, which were the first languages outside Python that the Jupyter
application was designed for. Jupyter Notebooks now supports over
40 coding languages. You may still find some references to iPython in materials
related to Jupyter Notebooks. This series will focus on using Jupyter Notebooks with Python, 
but the information presented can apply to other languages as well. 

The Jupyter Notebooks application is a browser-based application. Therefore, you 
need an updated browser (the Jupyter programmers recommend Mozilla Firefox or Google 
Chrome, but not Microsoft Explorer). When installed on your computer, you can 
always access the app even without internet access.  You can also use Jupyter 
installed on a remote server. For example, Jupyter runs a 
<a href="https://try.jupyter.org/" target="_blank"> training (temporary) server based version</a>. 

### Why Jupyter Notebooks?
There are many advantages to using Jupyter Notebooks in your work:

* Human readable syntax.
* Simple syntax - it can be learned quickly.
* All components of your work are clearly documented. You don't have to remember
what steps, assumptions, tests were used.
* You can easily extend or refine analyses by modifying existing or adding new
code blocks.
* Analysis results can be disseminated in various formats including HTML, PDF,
slideshows and more.
* Code and data can be shared with a colleague to replicate the workflow.

## Explore Examples of Notebooks 

Before we jump into how to work with notebooks, check out a few shared notebooks.
As you look at these different notebooks, what aspects of the layout do you like,
what don't you like?  Is there a place in your current workflow that these
notebooks would be useful?

Not only is this a great collection of example notebooks, but also it is a valuable
resource to learn other skills associated with using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

In the next tutorial, *<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/jupyter-python-intro" target="_blank">Introduction to using Jupyter Notebooks</a>*,
 we will learn more about working with Jupyter Notebooks.
