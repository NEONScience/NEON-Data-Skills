    "\n",
    "* Determine the available AOP datasets in Google Earth Engine\n",
    "* Read in and visualize AOP Reflectance, RGB Camera, and Lidar Raster datasets\n",
    "* Become familiar with the AOP Image Properties\n",
    "* Filter data based off image properties to pull in dataset(s) of interest\n",
    "* Explore the interactive mapping features in geemap\n",

    "To follow along with this code, you will need to \n",
    "1. Sign up for a non-commercial Google Earth Engine account here https://code.earthengine.google.com/register.\n",

    "In this lesson, you learned how to access the four NEON datasets that are available in GEE: Surface Directional Reflectance (SDR), Camera (RGB), and LiDAR-derived Digital Elevation (Terrain and Surface) Models (DTM and DSM) and Ecosystem Structure / Canopy Height Model (CHM). You generated code to determine which AOP datasets are available in GEE for a given Image Collection. You explored the SDR image properties and learned how to filter on specified metadata to pull out a subset of Images or a single Image from an Image Collection. You learned how to use `geemap` to add data layers to the interactive map panel. And lastly, you learned how to select and visualize the `Weather_Quality_Indicator` band, which is a useful first step in working with AOP reflectance data. \n",
