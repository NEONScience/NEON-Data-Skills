title: "Subsetting HDF5 files to make a smaller deliverable"
description: "Take a large HDF5 file and extract only the information that you need, then save as a new HDF5 file. For an example, we will take an existing hyperspectral dataset (~600Mb) and reduce it in size for subsequent tutorials."

In this tutorial, we will subset and existing HDF5 file containing NEON
hyperspectral data. The purpose of this exercise is to generate a smaller
file for use in subsequent tuorials.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this activity, you will be able to:

* Navigate an HDF5 file to identify the variables of interest.</li>
* Generate a new HDF5 file from a subset of the existing dataset.</li>
* Save the new HDF5 file for future use.

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Tutorial
To complete this tutorial you will need the most current version of R and, 
preferably, RStudio loaded on your computer.

### R Libraries to Install:

* **rhdf5**: `install.packages("BiocManager")`, `BiocManager::install("rhdf5")`
* **raster**: `install.packages('raster')`

## About Hyperspectral Data 
We often want to generate a 3 band image from multi or hyperspectral data. The 
most commonly recognized band combination is RGB which stands for Red, Green and 
Blue. RGB images are just like the images that your camera takes. But there are 
other band combinations that are useful too. For example, near infrared images 
emphasize vegetation and help us classify or identify where vegetation is located 
on the ground.
