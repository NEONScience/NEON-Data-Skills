The process of answering a research question begins with deciding what data are 
needed and finding/collecting the metadata needed to understand and work with 
the data. Once this is decided we can then decide on what tools we want to work 
with to manipulate, visualize, and analyze our data to answer our questions. 
This tutorial provides an overview of finding spatial data to support your
research question. It covers some of the key data sources, providers and
places that you can look to find data for your study are / research question.

## Answer Scientific Questions Using Data

We often begin a research project with one or more questions that we would like
to answer. Once we have a question, we identify the:

* Type of data needed to address the question.
* The spatial coverage required - location that the data should cover & spatial
extent.
* The required temporal coverage - time period that the data should span to
properly address the question.

Once we have identified these things, we can determine what methods are
needed to collect data needed to answer our question.

### Work With External Data

When our question requires data that are small in temporal and/or spatial scale,
we can often collect the data needed to answer the question ourselves. When we
ask questions that cover larger spatial (e.g. regions to continents) and
temporal scales, we often need to use data collected by other labs,
organizations, and agencies. We refer to these data as **external data** - data
that we have not collected ourselves.

### Metadata - Data That Describe the Data

When working with external data, we need to understand the metadata - the
documentation associated with a dataset that helps us understand collection and
processing methods, format and other key information including:

1. **What methods were used to collect and process the data**
in order to trust that it will be sufficient to answer our question.
2. **In what format & how the data are stored** - what methods were used to
indicate missing data values and bad data values in order to process the data
effectively and get accurate analysis results.
3. If the data are explicedly spatial (e.g. GIS-type data), then we need to
**understand key spatial *metadata*** to properly process and visualize the
data.

## Our Research Question: - Explore (Regional) Drivers and Patterns of Plant Phenology

For this series, and the associated 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/vector-data-series" target="_blank">*Intro to Vector Data in R*</a>,
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/series/introduction-working-raster-data-r" target="_blank">*Introduction to Working with Raster Data*</a>, and
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/tabular-time-series" target="_blank">*Introduction to Working With Time Series Data in Text Formats* </a> series, 
our research question is *What are (regional) drivers and patterns of plant phenology?* 

Our science topic for all of the tutorials in these series is plant phenology.
Our goal is to:

1. Better understand (to quantify) both the timing
of when plants turn green (green-up) and die back / turn brown (brown-down).
2. To quantify two key drivers of this timing - precipitation and temperature
and visualize how / if trends observed in precipitation and temperature relate
to trends observed in greening and browning of vegetation.
3. Additionally, we'd like to understand how / if "1" and "2" above vary at
different sites.

Our study area includes two National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) field
sites in the United States:

* Site One:the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV" target="_blank">**Harvard Forest (HARV)** </a>
located in Massachusetts in the northeastern United States.
* Site Two: the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/SJER" target="_blank">San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) </a>
located in the central region of the US state of California.

Both sites are mapped below:

```{r Field-Site-Map, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results="hide", message =FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Map of the United States with state borders shown and two NEON sites in Massachusetts and California highlighted."}

# create a map that shows the location of BOTH field sites.
# add a legend with a point for each site.
library(rgdal)

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where 
# we want to save our files. Be sure to move the download into your working directory! 
wd <- "~/Documents/data/" #This will depend on your local environment 
setwd(wd) 

# Read the Shapefiles
State.Boundary.US <- readOGR(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/US-Boundary-Layers"),
          "US-State-Boundaries-Census-2014")

Boundary.US <- readOGR(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/US-Boundary-Layers"),
          "US-Boundary-Dissolved-States")

# Plot the locations
plot(State.Boundary.US,
     main="NEON Field Site Locations \nHarvard Forest & San Joachin Experimental Range",
     border="grey")

plot(Boundary.US,
     add=TRUE)

# add HARV tower
# lat long: 42.5369, -72.17266

points(y=42.5369, x=-72.17266,
       col = "magenta",
       pch=19)

# Add SJER tower
# 37.10878, -119.73228
points(x=-119.73228,y=37.10878,
       col = "darkgreen",
       pch=19)

# add a legend to our map
legend("bottomleft",
       legend=c("Harvard Forest (HARV)","San Joaquin (SJER)"),
       pch=19,
       bty="n",
       col=c("magenta", "darkgreen"),
       cex=1.2)

```

These two sites are about 4,900km (3,000 miles) apart! Do we expect to see
differences in the timing of greening and browning of plants (phenophase timing)
between the two sites? If there are differences, what is causing them? Do the
two sites have the same drivers (causes) of phenologic change.

### Science Goals - Spatio-temporal Data in R Series

In the combined spatio-temporal tutorial series, our goal is to create plots of 
temperature, precipitation and the patterns of phenology - specifically the 
greening and browning of plants - for one year (2011) over two NEON field sites. 

To achieve this goal we need data that:

1. Cover the same time periods - temporal data *(year=2011)*.
2. Are for the same spatial locations *(our two field sites)*.
3. Are collected using similar methods so they are comparable at our two field
sites that are located 3,000+ miles apart!

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
### Challenge: Components of a Large Research Question

Consider the following questions:

1. What are some potential sources of data that might be useful to
address our phenology question?
2. How would you go about finding these data?

If you have a colleague nearby, discuss it with them!
</div>

## Project Components

One way to tackle our research project, is to break it down into smaller pieces.
We can  first identify the types of data that we need. We'd like to do the
following:

* **Map/plot phenophase timing at both sites:** We will need data that
quantify degree of greenness at both sites. Where can we get that and how do we
process it to plot greenness at both sites?
* **Understand our field sites:** To understand our sites we will need data that
"map" vegetation cover and show road locations and boundaries. We also might 
want to create a map of our study sites for a future publication.
	+ How large (spatial extent) are the sites?
	+ How dense is the vegetation?
	+ Where are the field sites located?
	+ Are the sites accessible by roads or difficult to get to?
* **Plots of temperature and precipitation:** Both are drivers of phenophase
timing. We want to plot each at both sites for the same *temporal duration* as
our greenness data.

## Phenology Data

Where do we start to find data that quantifies the timing of plant greening and
browning?

We could go outside and monitor individual plants and write down in field
notebooks when they turn green and brown. However, in this case, we can't
monitor enough plants over a large enough area by ourselves to quantify
greening and browning of entire forests or grasslands at multiple sites. To
answer our specific question at a regional scale, we need data that can measure
these events over larger areas.

### Phenology at Different Scales

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4uHLXL1yZA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


One way we can measure phenology over larger areas is to use
<a href="http://phenology.cr.usgs.gov/index.php" target="_blank">Remote Sensing imagery</a>
- data collected using high fidelity cameras mounted on satelites and airplanes.
Satellites continuously orbit the earth capturing images of the earth's surface.

The <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">Landsat sensor</a>,
captures images of the *same area every 16 days* which makes it a very powerful
spatio-temporal data source. Because the data are collected from
space, they cover a larger area. The data are standardized, collected using
the same "camera", so the data can be easily compared across sites and through
time.

### Introduction to Spectral Remote Sensing

This video explains how remote sensing cameras (spectral sensors) work.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3iaFzafWJQE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1"><i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Note:** 
<a href="http://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/" target="_blank">Phenocam data </a>
are another source of phenology data at the site scale. Phenocams are often
mounted on towers and capture repeat photography of vegetation each day. Learn
more about
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/phenocams">NEON phenocams here</a>.
</div>

### NDVI Measures Plant Greenness

We can use remote sensing imagery to derive the Normalized Difference Vegetation
Index (NDVI) - a quantitative index that measures how "green" or healthy
vegetation is on the ground. NDVI greenness values ranging from 0-1 where 0
represents minimal or no greenness and 1 represents maximum greenness. NDVI is
an ideal data product used to estimate the timing of plant "green-up" and
"brown-down" over large areas.

<figure>

 <img src="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/ContentFeature/MeasuringVegetation/Images/ndvi_example.jpg" alt="A green tree on the left absorbs most of the visible light and reflects half of near-infrared light while a brown tree on the right reflects more visible light and less near-infrared light. The green tree has a higher NDVI calculation."></a>
    <figcaption> NDVI is calculated from the visible and near-infrared light
    reflected by vegetation. Healthy vegetation (left) absorbs most of the
    visible light that hits it, and reflects a large portion of
    near-infrared light. Unhealthy or sparse vegetation (right) reflects more
    visible light and less near-infrared light. Source: NASA
    </figcaption>
</figure>

We can visualize NDVI remote sensing data and see the change in color
(representing the change in the index) as the growing season progresses across
the year. In this figure, each plot presents a snapshot of the NDVI values
across an area of 120m x 150m.

	<figcaption> Remote sensing data can be used to measure the greening and

## Find Remote Sensing Data

There are many sources that allow us to request and freely download remote
sensing imagery and products like NDVI. The National Ecological Observatory Network
(NEON) provides remote sensing data for all of their 81 field sites. This data
can be accessed through <a href="http://data.neonscience.org" target="_blank">the NEON Data Portal</a> or an API. 

For the United States, another popular data provider is the United States Geological Survey.

* <a href="http://glovis.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">USGS GLOVIS</a>
* <a href="http://landsatlook.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">Landsat Look Viewer</a>

Other, non-USGS sources of remote sensing data can be found in the
Data Sources list at the end of this tutorial.

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
### Challenge: Explore *Landsat Look* Website

Visit the
<a href="http://landsatlook.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">Landsat Look Viewer website</a>.
Search for any location of interest. One option could be a NEON Field site:
Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, United States.

Then answer the following questions:

1. Are data Landsat sensors are available for the area? If so, what Landsat sensors do the data
come from?
2. Is there cloud cover in any of the images?
3. What time period are the data available for?

Discuss with a colleague if you are working on this in a workshop!
</div>


## Remote Sensing Imagery - Raster Data Format

Remote sensing images are in **raster** format. They are composed of pixels -
just like the pixels in the images we take with our camera phones. Because we 
are studying phenophase timing, we need raster data collected
repeatedly through time to identify when groups of plants green-up and brown down.
We can use the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rasterVis/index.html" target="_blank"> `rasterVis` package in R </a> efficiently plot raster time series.

We will learn more about raster formats and how to work with them later in this 
series.

## Find Temperature and Precipitation Data

As a part of our research project, we also would like to plot three drivers of
green-up and brown-down phenophase stages:

* temperature (both air & soil temperature), 
* photosynthetically active radiation,and 
* precipitation.

Precipitation, temperature and other *micrometeorological* measurements are 
recorded at weather stations across
the globe. Many research and long term monitoring stations have towers with
sensors mounted on them that collect high frequency (many measurements a second
or minute) measurements of variables including temperature, precipitation, light
intensity, wind speed and more.

Some sources of climate data:

* <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/flux-tower-measurements" target="_blank"> **National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON):** </a>
data from a network of flux towers, that measure temperature,
precipitation, wind speed, light intensity and more. Field sites are located
across the United States. Data can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org" target="_blank">NEON data portal </a>.
* <a href="http://fluxnet.ornl.gov" target="_blank">**FluxNet:** </a>
a network of towers located around the world.
* <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data" target="_blank">**NOAA National Center for Environmental Information (formerly National Climatic Data Center):**</a>
from a
<a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank"> network of weather stations </a>
maintained by NOAA.
* <a href="https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/home.jsp" target="_blank">**Long Term Ecological Research sites (LTER):**</a>
Many LTER sites have micrometerology towers that collect climatic data.

### Climate Data At Our Field Sites

If we want climate data for our field sites, there are several places that
we can start. In our case,
<a href="http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/research/LTER/" target="_blank">Harvard Forest is a LTER site </a>,
so we can hope for a micrometerology tower that contains temperature and
precipitation sensors.
Visiting the
<a href="http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/research/stations" target="_blank"> Harvard Forest research stations home page</a>,
we learn that it has a meteorological station/flux tower that has been
collecting data since 2001. Better yet, the data are freely available for
download from the <a href="http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/harvard-forest-data-archive" target="_blank"> Harvard Forest data archives</a>.

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1"><i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Note:** Also 
note that there are some other data resources on this page including GIS data. 
Many research stations (not all) have these types of data available.
</div>

#### Micrometeorological Data from the Fisher Tower
The
<a href="http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/meteorological-hydrological-stations" target="_blank"> Harvard Forest Fisher Meteorological Station </a>
has been operational since 2001. It is located in an open field and records air
temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, incoming and net radiation,
barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, and soil temperature. Data is
available at 15-minute and daily intervals.

### Work With Time Series Data in R

The climate data are available for download in a Comma Separated Value (`.csv`) 
format. To work with these data in `R`, we will need to understand how to work 
with date and time formats.

<a href="/tabular-time-series" target="_blank">The *Introduction to Working With Time Series Data in Text Formats in R* tutorial series </a>
cover how to import time series data in `.csv` format into `R` and how to work 
with, subset and plot date & date/time formats.

<div id="ds-challenge" markdown="1">
### Challenge: Explore External Data from Harvard Forest
Revisiting the <a href="http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/data-archives" target="_blank"> Harvard Forest research station data archives</a>:

1. What other data are available for Harvard Forest?
2. Is there inforamtion that you'd consider metadata?
3. Which file formats do you recognize? Which are new to you?

</div>


## Data to Characterize our Study Site

It is often useful to create maps that characterize our field sites. Maps are integral to
planning site visits and plot locations prior to visiting. Maps
are useful tools to get to know a site's:

* Layout including roads, and other infrastructure.
* Topography (elevation)
* Vegetation height and cover

They are also essential for understanding sites that we may study using external
data but never visit because they are far away or access is
restricted. Maps are also useful for describing our field sites in publications.

### Map Site Infrastructure: Buildings, Roads, Streams

The most basic map that we might draw of our site is one showing the
infrastructure on a site, including roads, trails, streams, buildings and other
landmarks. These points (e.g., field house), linear (e.g., trails & streams),
and boundary type data are often found in **shapefile format** ( `.shp`).
This is a **vector format** that is read by most **GIS programs**.

We will learn more about vector formats later in this series. 

### Map Topography & Vegetation Cover - LiDAR

**Light Detection and Ranging Data (LiDAR)** data provide high resolution,
accurate topography (elevation) and three-dimensional vegetation cover and
structure (density and height) information. LiDAR can also be used to find the
location of roads and streams (a way to initially create the shapefiles
mentioned above).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYbhNSUnIdU&feature=youtu.be" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


### Sources of LiDAR Data

As LiDAR is most often captured from an airplane, the coverage of publically
available LiDAR-derived data products is much less than that of satellite-based
remote sensing. Research stations may have Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and
Canopy Height Models (CHM), that map elevation and vegetation height
respectively, or other LiDAR-derived data available for researchers.


* <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/airborne-remote-sensing/tips-getting-airborne-data" target="_blank"> **NEON airborne observation platform** data</a>
* <a href="http://www.opentopography.org/" target="_blank">**Open Topography**: </a>
a great source of free LiDAR data in the US.
* <a href="http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/" target="_blank"> **USGS LiDAR data**</a>

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1"><i class="fa fa-star"></i> 
**Data Note:** In the United States, state-wide data
are often also available locally. State GIS offices are often a good source of
information and sometimes have online repositories to access the data.
</div>

#### NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP)
The
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/airborne-remote-sensing" target="_blank"> NEON airborne observation platform </a>
(AOP) collects annual remote sensing data over NEON field sites using sensors
mounted on an airplane. The AOP consists of a hyperspectral imaging
spectrometer, a full waveform and discrete return LiDAR, and a high-resolution
Red Blue Green (RGB) camera. Data from the AOP build a robust time series of
landscape-scale changes in numerous physical, biological and biochemical
metrics, such as vegetation cover and density, canopy chemistry, and topography,
including elevation, slope and aspect.

## Challenge Question Answers

### Challenge: Components of a Large Research Question
