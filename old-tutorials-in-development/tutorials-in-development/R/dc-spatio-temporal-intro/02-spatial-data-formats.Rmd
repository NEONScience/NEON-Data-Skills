## Get Started With Your Project -  File Organization

When we work with large, spatio-temporal data, it is a good idea to store large
datasets in a general data directory that you can easily access from many
projects. If you are working in a collaborative
environment, use a shared data directory.

## One Dataset - Many Files

While text files often are self contained (one CSV) and composed of one unique file,
many spatial formats contain several files. For instance, a shapefile (discussed
below) contains 3 or more files, all of which must retain the same NAME and be
stored in the same file directory, in order for you to be able to work with them.
We will discuss these issues as they related to two key spatial data formats -
.shp (shapefile) which stores **vector** data and .tif (geotiff) which stores
**raster** data in more detail, below.


## Types of Spatial Data

Spatial data are represented in many different ways and are stored in different
file formats. In this tutorial, we will focus on the two types of spatial data:
raster and vector data.

## Vector Data - Points, Lines, Polygons

Vector data are often used to store things like road and plot locations,
boundaries of states, countries and lakes.

Vector data are composed of discrete geometric locations (x,y values) known as
**vertices** that define the "shape" of the spatial object. The organization
of the vertices determines the type of vector that we are working
with: **point**, **line** or **polygon**.

    <figcaption> There are 3 types of vector objects: points, lines or
    polygons. Each vector object type has a different structure.

</figure>

* **Points:** Each individual point is defined by a **single x, y coordinate**.
There can be many points in a vector point file. Examples of point data include:
	+ sampling locations,
	+ the location of individual trees or
	+ the location of plots.
* **Lines:** Lines are composed of **many (at least 2) vertices that
are connected**. For instance, a road or a stream may be represented by a line.
This line is composed of a series of segments, each "bend" in the road or stream
represents a vertex that has defined `x, y` location.
* **Polygons:** A polygon consists of **3 or more vertices that are connected
and "closed"**. Occasionally, a polygon can have a hole in the middle of it
(like a doughnut), this is something to be aware of but not an issue we will
deal with in this tutorial series. Objects often represented by polygons
include:
	+ outlines of plot boundaries,
	+ lakes,
	+ oceans and
	+ states or country boundaries.  


<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** A shapefile will only contain **one
type of vector data**: points, lines or polygons.
{: .notice}

```{r import-vector, warning=FALSE}

# load libraries required to work with spatial data
library(raster) # commands to view metadata from vector objects
library(rgdal) # library of common GIS functions

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where 
# we want to save our files. Be sure to move the download into your working directory! 
wd <- "~/Documents/data/" #This will depend on your local environment 
setwd(wd) 

# Open shapefile
roads_HARV <- readOGR(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV","HARV_roads"))

# view slots available for the object
slotNames(roads_HARV)

# view all methods available for that object
methods(class = class(roads_HARV))

```


## Stucture of a Lines Feature

If we are working with a shapefile containing **line** data, then each line
consists of 2 or more vertices that are connected. We can view each set of coordinates
for that object using `R`.

```{r view-lines-coordinates }

# view the coordinates for each vertex, for the last feature in the spatial object
roads_HARV@lines[13]

# view the coordinates for the last feature in the spatial object
roads_HARV@lines[14]

```


<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
Question - Why didn't `roads_HARV@lines[14]` return any vertex coordinates?
</div>

## Spatial Data Attributes

Each object in a shapefile, is called a `feature`. Each `feature` has one or
more `attributes` associated with it.

Shapefile attributes are similar to fields or columns in a spreadsheet. Each row
in the spreadsheet has a set of columns associated with it that describe the row
element. In the case of a shapefile, each row represents a spatial object - for
example, a road, represented as a line in a line shapefile, will have one "row"
of attributes associated with it. These attributes can include different types
of information that describe shapefile `features`. Thus, a road,
may have a name, length, number of lanes, speed limit, type of road and other
attributes stored with it.

    <figcaption>Each spatial feature in an R spatial object has the same set of
    associated attributes that describe or characterize the feature.
    Attribute data are stored in a separate *.dbf file. Attribute data can be
    compared to a spreadsheet. Each row in a spreadsheet represents one feature
    in the spatial object.

```

In the map below of the Harvard Forest field site, there are many different features
with different spatial object types. We will learn to create maps like this in
the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/vector-data-series" target="_blank"> *Introduction to Working with Vector Data in R* tutorial series</a>

### Challenge: Shapefiles

Have a look at the map above:  **Study Plots by Soil Type**. What is the minimum number of
shapefiles that are required to create this map? How do you know?

</div>


```{r challenge-code-shapefiles, echo=FALSE}


# Two. There are both points (study plots labelled in legend by the soil type)
# and lines (the boardwalk, footpath, stone walls, and woods road in legend) in
# this map. Since there are two different types of vectors (points & lines)
# there must be two shapefiles as a single shapefile can only contain 1 type of
# vector data.

```



### Shapefile Structure

When working with shapefiles, it is important to remember that a shapefile
 consists of 3 (or more) files:

* **`.shp`:** the file that contains the geometry for all features.
* **`.shx`:** the file that indexes the geometry.
* **`.dbf`:** the file that stores feature attributes in a tabular format.


These files need to have the **same name** and to be stored in the same
directory (folder) to open properly in a GIS, `R` or `Python` tool.

Sometimes, a shapefile will have other associated files including:

* `.prj`: the file that contains information on projection format including
the coordinate system and projection information. It is a plain text file
describing the projection using well-known text (WKT) format.
* `.sbn` and `.sbx`: the files that are a spatial index of the features.
* `.shp.xml`: the file that is the geospatial metadata in XML format, (e.g.
ISO 19115 or XML format).

## Data Management - Sharing Shapefiles

When you work with a shapefile, you must keep all of the key associated
file types together. And when you share a shapefile with a colleague, it is
important to zip up all of these files into one package before you send it to
them!

We cover working with shapefiles in `R` in the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/vector-data-series" target="_blank"> *Introduction to Working with Vector Data in R* tutorial series</a>.

### Vector Data in .CSV Format

The shapefile format is one (very common) way to store vector data. However,
you may encounter it in other formats. For example, sometimes, point data are
stored as a Comma Separated Value (.CSV) format.


We cover working with vector points in .csv format in the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/dc-csv-to-shapefile-r" target="_blank"> *Convert from .csv to a Shapefile in R* tutorial</a>.

## Raster Data

Raster or "gridded" data are saved on a uniform grid and rendered on a map
as pixels. Each pixel contains a value that represents an area on the Earth's
surface.

### GeoTIFF

There are many different raster data file formats. In this tutorial series, we
will focus on the `GeoTIFF`. The `GeoTIFF` format is similar to the `.tif`
format, however the `GeoTIFF` format stores additional spatial `metadata`.

```{r import-tif }
# view attributes for a geotif file
GDALinfo("NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/CHM/HARV_chmCrop.tif")

# import geotiff
chm_HARV <- raster("NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/CHM/HARV_chmCrop.tif")

chm_HARV

```


### Metadata in .tif Files

The `tif` and `GeoTIFF` formats stores `metadata` as embedded `tif tags`. These
tags can include the following raster metadata:

1. A Coordinate Reference System (`CRS`)
2. Spatial Extent (`extent`)
3. Values for when no data is provided (`NoData Value`)
4. The `resolution` of the data


We will explore metadata in tif files in the next tutorial -
[Spatial Intro 03: Data About Data -- Intro to Metadata File Formats and Structure](https://www.neonscience.org/R/metadata-file-formats-structures)

IMPORTANT: just because a `.tif` file can store metadata tags, doesn't mean
that metadata are always included! If the data creator doesn't actively add
`.tif` tags, then they may not be there for us to use.

### Metadata - Saving .tif Files in R

In `R`, and many other `GIS` tools, it's important to ensure that `.tif` tags
are properly saved when you export a `.tif`. For example, when using the
`writeRaster()`function in `R`, if you do not specify the `NA` (noData) value
when you export a GeoTIFF, it will default to a different value which could be
read incorrectly in other programs!

```{r na-value-tiff, eval=FALSE}

# if you want a NA value of -9999, then you have to specify this when you
# export a raster file in R
exampleRaster <- writeRaster(rasterObject,  # object to export/write
                             FileName.tif,  # name of new .tif file
                             datatype = "INT1U",  # the data type
                             NAflag = -9999)  # your desired NA or noData value
```

We cover writing `NA` values using the `writeRaster` function in R in <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/dc-raster-calculations-r" target="_blank"> *Raster Calculations in R - Subtract One Raster from Another and Extract Pixel Values For Defined Locations* tutorial</a>.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Note:** `Tif tags` - metadata tags stored
within a `tif` or `GeoTIFF` file are also what your camera uses to store
information about how and when a picture was taken! And how your computer reads
this metadata and identifies, for example, the make and model of the camera or
the date the photo was taken.
