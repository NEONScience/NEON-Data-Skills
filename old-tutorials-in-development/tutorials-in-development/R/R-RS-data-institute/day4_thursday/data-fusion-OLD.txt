First, let's load the required libraries.

```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
# load libraries
library(raster)
library(rhdf5)
library(rgdal)

# setwd("C:/Users/kdahlin/Dropbox/NEON_WWDI_2016")
setwd("~/Documents/data/1_data-institute-2016")
```


The first thing that we can do is load the functions that we want to use into
our environment. This makes it easy to quickly access these functions without
having to retype the function code into our script. This also makes it easy to
maintain function code that we use regularly in ONE PLACE. 

```{r import-h5-functions }

# your file will be in your working directory!

# this is also an R package!
source("/Users/lwasser/Documents/GitHub/neon-aop-package/neonAOP/R/aop-data.R")
```

## Import NEON Lidar Data Products

First, let's import several NEON lidar data products. 

# KYLA - Do we need the DSM and DTM now that we have a CHM pre-processed?

```{r import-lidar }

# import digital surface model (dsm) (top of the surface - includes trees and buildings)
dsm <- raster("NEONdata/D17-California/TEAK/2013/lidar/Teak_lidarDSM.tif")
# import  digital terrain model (dtm), elevation
dtm <- raster("NEONdata/D17-California/TEAK/2013/lidar/Teak_lidarDTM.tif") 

# import canopy height model (height of vegetation) 
chm <- raster("NEONdata/D17-California/TEAK/2013/lidar/Teak_lidarCHM.tif")

```


## Explore CHM 
Next, let's explore our CHM data.

```{r}

# do the numbers look reasonable? 60 m is tall for a tree, but
# this is Ponderosa pine territory (I think), so not out of the question.
plot(chm,
     main="Canopy Height - Teakettle \nCalifornia") 

hist(chm,
     main="Distribution of Canopy Height - Teakettle \nCalifornia",
     xlab="Tree Height (m)", 
     col="springgreen")

```

## Valid Data Range

The valid range of data for a NEON CHM is >= 2m. This is because the lidar system
is not sensitive enough to distinguish objects that are closer than ~2m apart vertically.

# Kyla- i've commented this out for the time being. Just note that there are no values between 0 and 2.
# if you think we should leave chm values of 0, let's leave them. They just mean no vegetation.

```{r remove-nonvalid-values}
# assign chm values of 0 to NA
# chm[chm < 2] <- NA
hist(chm, 
     main="Distribution of Canopy Height - Teakettle \nCalifornia",
     xlab="Tree Height (m)", 
     col="springgreen")

```

## Explore Veg Height data

Have a close look at the veg height values. Do they seem reasonable?

## Create LiDAR Raster Brick

Next, we can stack the rasters together to create a brick.

# Kyla - we can skip this step here IF we don't need the dtm, dsm.

```{r create-stack }
# for simplicity later let's stack these rasters together
# do we need the dtm dsm??
lidar.brick <- brick(dsm, dtm, chm)

```

## Read Hyperspectral Data 

Next, let's read in HSI data.

# KYLA - we can skip this too if you are OK with using our NDVI data product
# we also have EVI! We could use that too for greenness?

```{r read-hsi-data, eval=FALSE}

# first identify the file of interest
#f <- "NEONdata/D17-California/TEAK/2013/spectrometer/reflectance/Subset3NIS1_20130614_100459_atmcor.h5"
# then id the projection code
# define the CRS definition by EPSG code
#epsg <- 32611

# create a list of bands
#bands <- c(60,83)

# Let's read in a few spectral bands as a stack using a function
#ndvi.stack <- create_stack(bands = bands,
#             epsg=epsg)

# calculate ndvi
#ndvi <- (ndvi.stack[[2]]-ndvi.stack[[1]]) / (ndvi.stack[[2]]+ndvi.stack[[1]])
#names(ndvi) <- "Teak_hsiNDVI"
# check the extents of the two layers -- if they are different
# crop both datasets 
#if (extent(chm) == extent(ndvi)){
#  } else {
#  overlap <- intersect(extent(ndvi), extent(lidar.brick))
  # now let's crop the lidar data to the HSI data
#  lidar.brick <- crop(lidar.brick, overlap)
#  ndvi <- crop(ndvi, overlap)
#  print("Extents are different, cropping data")
#  }


```

## Import NDVI data

We can import the NEON NDVI data product next to use in our analysis.

```{r import-NDVI }

# import NDVI
ndvi <- raster("NEONdata/D17-California/TEAK/2013/spectrometer/veg_index/NEON.D17.TEAK.DP2.20130614_100459_NDVI.tif")

# plot NDVI
plot(ndvi,
     main="NDVI, TEAK Field Site")

```

## Create Brick of lidar and NDVI

```{r create-brick}

# Create a brick from all of the data 
all.data <- brick(ndvi, lidar.brick)

# make names nice!
all.names <- c("NDVI", "DSM", "DTM", "CHM" )
names(all.data) <- all.names

```


## Consider Slope & Aspect

Next, let's test a simple hypothesis. 

Because California is:

* dry and 
* In the northern hemisphere.

We may expect to find taller, greener vegetation on north facing slopes than on 
south facing slopes. To test this we need to 

1. Import the NEON aspect data product.
2. Isolate north and south facing slopes. 
3. Decide what we mean by 'tall' and 'green'.
4. Isolate tall, green pixels on north & south facing slopes. 
5. Examine the percent of pixels for tall green pixels on north vs south facing slopes.
6. Run a t-test to compare all pixels.

Let's get started.

### Step 1. Import Aspect data product

```{r import-aspect }

# 1. Import aspect data product (derived from the DTM)
aspect <- raster("NEONdata/D17-California/TEAK/2013/lidar/Teak_lidarAspect.tif")
# crop the data to the extent of the other rasters we are working with
aspect <- crop(aspect, extent(chm))

```


<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**Data Tip:** You can create an aspect layer from a 
DEM / DTM using the terrain function: `terrain(all.data[[3]], opt = "aspect", unit = "degrees", neighbors = 8)`
</div>

### 2. Create Aspect Mask

Next we will create a mask using the aspect data product. Values are as follows:

* South Facing: 135-225 degrees
* North Facing: 315-360 and 0-45 degrees

We can do this by reclassifying the aspect data product using the `reclassify` 
function in the `raster` package. 

First we need to create MATRIX that has 3 columns. the first two columns
represent the data values within a range that we want to classify. The third column
contains the new value that we will assign that range of values to. For example:

0 to 45 degrees should be classified as 1 (North Facing)
135 to 225 degrees should be classified as 2 (South Facing)
Greater than 315 should be classified as 1 (North Facing)


```{r create-aspect-mask}

# Create a classified aspect intermediate output 
# first create a matrix of values that represent the classification ranges
# North face = 1
# South face = 2
class.m <- c(0, 45, 1, 
             45, 135, NA, 
             135, 225, 2,  
             225 , 315, NA, 
             315, 360, 1)
# reshape into a matrix
rcl.m <- matrix(class.m, 
                ncol=3, 
                byrow=TRUE)
rcl.m
# classify the aspect product using the classification matrix
asp.ns <- reclassify(aspect, rcl.m)
# set 0 values to NA
asp.ns[asp.ns==0] <- NA

```

```{r plot-aspect-product} 

# define the extetn of the map -
# this is used to place the legend on the plot.
ns.extent <- extent(asp.ns)

# plot data

plot(asp.ns, 
     col=c("blue","green"),
     axes=F,
     main="North and South Facing Slopes \nNEON Teakettle Field Site",
     bty="n",
     legend=F)

# allow legend to plot outside of bounds
par(xpd=TRUE)

legend((par()$usr[2] + 20), ns.extent@ymax-100, # set xy legend location
       legend = c("North", "South"),
       fill = c("blue", "green"), 
       bty="n") # turn off border

```

## North / South Facing Slopes

Next, we can create a north and south facing mask object. A mask is a layer where
the pixels that you want to EXCLUDE are set to NA. The pixels that you wish to 
include in your analysis have a value. In this case, that value is 1.

```{r ns-facing }

# create north facing mask object
north.facing <- asp.ns==1
north.facing[north.facing == 0] <- NA

# Create south facing mask object
south.facing <- asp.ns==2
south.facing[south.facing == 0] <- NA

```

## Export North South Aspect Geotiff

Before we go any further, let's export a geotiff. This could be useful for another
analysis. 

```{r export-gtif-ns, eval=FALSE}

# export geotiff 
writeRaster(asp.ns,
            filename="outputs/TEAK/Teak_nsAspect.tif",
            format="GTiff",
            options="COMPRESS=LZW",
            overwrite = TRUE,
            NAflag = -9999)

```

## 3. Identify Veg Metrics

Now we want to determine what defines "tall" and "green". We can explore histograms
of our data and use descriptive statistics to determine what values might make
the most sense. 

# kyla i've used the summary command to create a data.frame of summar stats rather than
# creating each individually. I think it is a bit more efficient. Are you ok with that?

```{r id-veg-metrics }

# histogram of tree ht
hist(all.data[[4]],
     main="Distribution of Canopy Height Model (CHM) values \nNEON Teakettle Field Site",
     col="springgreen")

# get mean, min max stats to use later
# chm.stats <- data.frame(t(summary(all.data[[4]], na.rm=F)))
# chm.stats$mean <- ht.mean <- cellStats(all.data[[4]], mean)
# chm.stats$sd <- ht.mean <- cellStats(all.data[[4]], sd)


# get mean, min max stats for all layers
all.data.stats <- data.frame(t(summary(all.data, na.rm=T)))
all.data.stats$mean <- ht.mean <- cellStats(all.data, mean, na.rm=T)
all.data.stats$sd <- ht.mean <- cellStats(all.data, sd, na.rm=T)

row.names(all.data.stats) <- all.names

# view data.frame
all.data.stats

# let's be semi-robust and call 'tall' trees those with mean + 1 sd
ht.threshold <- all.data.stats["CHM","mean"] + all.data.stats["CHM","sd"]
ht.threshold

```

# Kyla -- note that because we included CHM values of 0 in our analysis
# the tall. ht.threhold is actually LOWER. the 0's are included in our
# threshold which i think skews the mean because there are a LOT of 0's. 
# something to note.

Next, look at NDVI.

# KYLA - would taking the 3rd quartile be ok here? 
### I think either is fine but 3rd quartile is like 0.67, which is really high, so even
### less data than using top third (~0.55)

## OK - well let m eknow what you think. the nice thing with the quartile is that
## it's a calculate statistic - however i'm open to whatever you think is best.

```{r explore-ndvi}
# now let's look at ndvi
hist(all.data[[1]],
     main="Distribution of NDVI values\n Teakettle",
     col="springgreen")

# this is a nice bimodal dataset, so let's just take the top 1/3 of the data
# could take the 3rd quartile
# do this using summary stats
# stats <- summary(all.data[[1]])
# stats[["3rd Qu.", 1]]

# or manually calculate the top third
green.range <- all.data.stats["NDVI","Max."] - all.data.stats["NDVI","Min."]
green.threshold <- all.data.stats["NDVI","Max."] - (green.range/3)

```

# KYLA - please note that we have NDVI values that are negative because there is
# rock -- so the green range may not be ideal for this type of analysis
# do we want to floor NDVI to 0 because of this as we are focused on veg in this 
# analysis?

## 4. Calculate Percent of tall and green pixels 

Next, let's calculate the percent of tall and green pixels that occur on 
north and south facing slopes. Our pixels are exactly 1 x 1 m in size, thus
we can use the % of pixels as a proxy for % area. 

Remember that 1 = North Facing and 2 = South Facing in our classified aspect
object `asp.ns`.

```{r calculate-percent}

# North = 1 and South facing = 2, calculate total pixels
north.count <- freq(asp.ns, value =1)
south.count <- freq(asp.ns, value =2)

# note there's  more south facing area in this image than north facing

# create a new layer with pixels that are north facing, above the green threshold and
# above the CHM height threshold
north.tall.green <- asp.ns == 1  & 
                    all.data[[1]] >= green.threshold & 
                    all.data[[4]] >= ht.threshold

# assign values of 0 to NA so this becomes a mask
north.tall.green[north.tall.green == 0] <- NA

# how many pixels fit the "north, tall green" criteria?
north.tall.green.count <- freq(north.tall.green, value =1)


# repeat the same steps for south facing slopes. Note
# we are repeating code - this could become a nice function!
south.tall.green <- asp.ns == 2 & 
                    all.data[[1]] >= green.threshold & 
                    all.data[[4]] >= ht.threshold

south.tall.green.count <- freq(south.tall.green, value=1)
south.tall.green[south.tall.green == 0] <- NA

# divide the number of pixels that are green by the total north facing pixels
north.tall.green.frac <- north.tall.green.count/freq(asp.ns, value=1)
south.tall.green.frac <- south.tall.green.count/freq(asp.ns, value=2)

# if we look at these fracs, >11% of the pixels on north facing slopes should
# meet our tall and green criteria, while <6% of the pixels on south facing
# slopes do. So that's reassuring. (using original dataset)

```

# Kyla - what's happening in this code is we are generating a lot of small r objects.
# green.def, thresholds, etc
# i'd probably create a data.frame with them all in there which will be much
# easier to keep track of. so maybe a dataframe with all of the pixel counts for
# north and south tall green and asp.ns would be nice. Then maybe a threshold data.frame

## Plot Color Infrared (CIR) Image

Next, let's have a look at the site that we are working with. We can use the 
Hyperspectral remote sensing data to plot a color infrared image. 

We will use the following bands:


| Color |Band Number   |Wavelength   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  Blue | 35  |~ 550nm   |   |   |
| Green| 60  | ~ 550nm  |   |   |
| Near-Infrared  | 83  |   ~ 550nm|   |   |

We can use the `create_stack` function that is a part of the NEON AOP R package
of functions to quickly import the three bands. Then we can use `plotRGB` to 
plot the bands as an RGB image. 

```{r view-cir }

f <- "NEONdata/D17-California/TEAK/2013/spectrometer/reflectance/Subset3NIS1_20130614_100459_atmcor.h5"

# define the CRS definition by EPSG code
epsg <- 32611

# create a list of bands
bands <- c(83, 60, 35)

# Let's read in a few spectral bands as a stack using a function
cir.stack <- create_stack(file=f,
                          bands = bands,
                          epsg=epsg)

# ignore reflectance values > 1
cir.stack[cir.stack > 1] <- NA

# plot cir image
plotRGB(cir.stack, 
        scale = 1, 
        stretch = "lin")

plot(north.tall.green, 
     col = "cyan", 
     add = T, 
     legend = F)
plot(south.tall.green, 
     col = "blue", 
     add = T, 
     legend = F)





```

# KYLA - i appreciate your comment below! Should we expand on this?
# Note here that there are clusters where 'south facing' and 'north facing'
# pixels are very close together - this is due to the very fine resolution of the
# topo data. One might want to either smooth this data (low-pass filter) or
# use a larger kernel to calculate slope (not possible with the terrain fxn in
# the raster package)


```{r run-stats}
# (5) let's do some stats! t-test and boxplots of veg height and greenness 
# distributions in north versus south facing parts of scene.

# let's start with NDVI - isolate NDVI on north and south facing slopes
north.NDVI <- mask(all.data[[1]], north.facing)
south.NDVI <- mask(all.data[[1]], south.facing)

```

## Grab Values

```{r compare-aspect-NDVI }

## get values and coerce to north values to dataframe
north.ndvi.df <- na.omit(as.data.frame(getValues(north.NDVI)))
north.ndvi.df$aspect <- rep("north", length(north.ndvi.df[,1]))
names(north.ndvi.df) <- c("NDVI","aspect")

south.ndvi.df <- na.omit(as.data.frame(getValues(south.NDVI)))
south.ndvi.df$aspect <- rep("south", length(south.ndvi.df[,1]))
names(south.ndvi.df) <- c("NDVI","aspect")

ndvi.df <- rbind(north.ndvi.df, south.ndvi.df)
# convert aspect to factor - NOTE you don't have to do this
ndvi.df$aspect <- as.factor(ndvi.df$aspect)

boxplot(NDVI ~ aspect, 
        data = ndvi.df, 
        col = "cornflowerblue", 
        main = "NDVI on North versus South facing slopes")


# and now a t-test - note that since these aren't normally distributed, this
# might not be the best approach, but ok for a quick assessment.
NDVI.ttest <- t.test(north.ndvi.df$NDVI, 
                     south.ndvi.df$NDVI, 
                     alternative = "greater")

```

# KYLA - I suggest that we remove the code below as it's it's more challenging to replicate.
# are you ok with that?

```{r another-solution }

# now to do more complicated non-spatial stats in R we need to convert our
# raster data to vectors - for this example the spatial distribution of the
# data doesn't matter.

#north.NDVI.vec <- getValues(north.NDVI)
#south.NDVI.vec <- getValues(south.NDVI)


# and get rid of NAs for simplicity (the above vectors are all the same length
# and include all the cells in the original dataset)

#north.NDVI.vec <- north.NDVI.vec[!is.na(north.NDVI.vec)]
#south.NDVI.vec <- south.NDVI.vec[!is.na(south.NDVI.vec)]

# now let's make a data frame with a north versus south column
#aspect.NDVI <- c(rep("north", length(north.NDVI.vec)), 
#                 rep("south", length(south.NDVI.vec)))
#aspect.NDVI <- as.factor(aspect.NDVI)

#NDVI.vec <- c(north.NDVI.vec, south.NDVI.vec)

# this (below) is clunky - I thought I could use cbind but 'factors' are getting the 
# best of me
#NDVI.dat <- as.data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = length(NDVI.vec), ncol = 2))
#names(NDVI.dat) <- c("aspect", "NDVI")
#NDVI.dat[,1] <- aspect.NDVI
#NDVI.dat[,2] <- NDVI.vec
#boxplot(NDVI ~ aspect, data = NDVI.dat, col = "cornflowerblue", main = "NDVI 
#        on North versus South facing slopes")

# and now a t-test - note that since these aren't normally distributed, this
# might not be the best approach, but ok for a quick assessment.
# NDVI.ttest <- t.test(north.NDVI.vec, south.NDVI.vec, alternative = "greater")

```

## Veg Height

Run the same analysis but use veg height!
Once again we are repeating code. This would make for a nice function! If it's a 
set of functions, we can change the methods in ONE PLACE and then re run the code!

# KYLA - id suggest that we hide this code and have them do this
# part as a hands-on challenge!


```{r veght-aspect-compare }
# mask tall pixels on north and south facing slopes 
north.veght <- mask(all.data[[4]], north.facing)
south.veght <- mask(all.data[[4]], south.facing)

## get values and coerce to north values to dataframe
north.veght.df <- na.omit(as.data.frame(getValues(north.veght)))
north.veght.df$aspect <- rep("north", length(north.veght.df[,1]))
names(north.veght.df) <- c("veght","aspect")

south.veght.df <- na.omit(as.data.frame(getValues(south.veght)))
south.veght.df$aspect <- rep("south", length(south.veght.df[,1]))
names(south.veght.df) <- c("veght","aspect")

veght.df <- rbind(north.veght.df, south.veght.df)
# convert aspect to factor - NOTE you don't have to do this
veght.df$aspect <- as.factor(veght.df$aspect)

boxplot(veght ~ aspect, 
        data = veght.df, 
        col = "cornflowerblue", 
        main = "veght on North versus South facing slopes")


# and now a t-test - note that since these aren't normally distributed, this
# might not be the best approach, but ok for a quick assessment.
veght.ttest <- t.test(north.veght.df$veght, south.veght.df$veght, alternative = "greater")

```


# KYLA - if you are OK with the above code, i'd remove the code below.
# please note the skew in the results. this is because we are using values =0 which
# dominate the data due to the rock.

```{r veg-ht}

# # isolate veg height pixels on north and south facing slopes
# north.veght <- all.data[[4]] * north.facing
# south.veght <- all.data[[4]] * south.facing
# 
# # and now for veg height
# north.veght.vec <- getValues(north.veght)
# south.veght.vec <- getValues(south.veght)
# 
# north.veght.vec <- north.veght.vec[!is.na(north.veght.vec)]
# south.veght.vec <- south.veght.vec[!is.na(south.veght.vec)]
# 
# # now let's make a data frame with a north versus south column
# aspect.veght <- c(rep("north", length(north.veght.vec)), 
#                  rep("south", length(south.veght.vec)))
# aspect.veght <- as.factor(aspect.veght)
# 
# veght.vec <- c(north.veght.vec, south.veght.vec)
# 
# veght.dat <- as.data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = length(veght.vec), ncol = 2))
# names(veght.dat) <- c("aspect", "veght")
# veght.dat[,1] <- aspect.veght
# veght.dat[,2] <- veght.vec
# boxplot(veght ~ aspect, data = veght.dat, col = "aquamarine4", main = "Veg Ht 
#         on North versus South facing slopes")
# 
# # same caution as above!
# veght.ttest <- t.test(north.veght.vec, south.veght.vec, alternative = "greater")


```
