This tutorial covers add new edits/contents from your forked repo on github.com 
and a central repo.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Explain the concept of base fork and head fork.
* Know how to transfer changes (sync) between a fork & a central repo in GitHub.
* Create a Pull Request on the GitHub.com website.


## Additional Resources:

* <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf" target="_blank"> Diagram of Git Commands: </a>
this diagram includes more commands than we will
learn in this series.

We now have done the following:

1. We've **forked** (made an individual copy of) the `NEON-WorkWithData/DI-NEON-participants` repo to
our github.com account.
2. We've **cloned** the forked repo - making a copy of it on our local computers.
3. We've added files and content to our local copy of the repo and **committed**
 the changes.
4. We've **pushed** those changes back up to our forked repo on github.com.

Once you've forked and cloned a repo, you are all setup to work on your project.
You won't need to repeat those steps.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to transfer changes from our forked
repo in our github.com account to the central NEON Data Institute repo. Adding 
information from your forked repo to the central repo in GitHub is done using a
**pull request**.

 <div class="notice" markdown="1">
 <i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**
 A pull request to another repo is similar to a "push". However it allows
 for a few things:

 1. It allows you to contribute to another repo without needing administrative
 privileges to make changes to the repo.
 2. It allows others to review your changes and suggest corrections, additions,
 edits, etc.
 3. It allows repo administrators control over what gets added to
 their project repo.

 The ability to suggest changes to ANY (public) repo, without needing administrative
 privileges is a powerful feature of GitHub. In our case, you do not have privileges
 to actually make changes to the DI-NEON-participants repo. However you can
 make as many changes
 as you want in your fork, and then suggest that NEON add those changes to their
 repo, using a pull request. Pretty cool!

 </div>

## Adding to a Repo Using Pull Requests

## Pull Requests in GitHub

#### Step 1 - Start Pull Request
To start a pull request, click the pull request button on the main repo page.

 <figure>
	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/pre-institute-content/pre-institute2-git/Git-ForkScreenshot-PR.png">
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/pre-institute-content/pre-institute2-git/Git-ForkScreenshot-PR.png"></a>

Data Institute participants repo (Note, screenshot shows a previous version of 
the repo, however, the button is in the same location). Source: National Ecological Observatory
Network (NEON)  
	</figcaption>
</figure>

Alternatively, you can click the Pull requests tab, then on this new page click the
"New pull request" button.

#### Step 2 - Choose Repos to Update
Select your fork to compare with NEON central repo. When you begin a pull 
request, the head and base will auto-populate as follows:

* base fork: **NEON-WorkWithData/DI-NEON-participants**
* head fork: **YOUR-USER-NAME/DI-NEON-participants**

The above pull request configuration tells Git to sync (or update) the NEON repo
with contents **from your repo**. 

**Head vs Base**

* **Base:** the repo that will be updated, the changes will be added to this repo.
* **Head:** the repo from which the changes come.

One way to remember this is that the “head” is always a*head* of the base, so
we must add from the head to the base.

	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/pre-institute-content/pre-institute2-git/Git-PR-compareForks.png"></a>
	<figcaption> To update your repo you need to set the base fork to
   `YOUR-USER-NAME/DI-NEON-participants`. Then click the "compare across forks"
   link. This will allow you to set the head fork to `NEON-WorkWithData/DI-NEON-participants` .

#### Step 3 - Verify Changes
When you compare two repos in a pull request page, git will provide an overview
of the differences (diffs) between the files (if the file is a binary file, like 
code. Non-binary files will just show up as a fully new file if it had any changes).
Look over the changes and make sure nothing looks surprising.

	and newer (RIGHT) document. Deletions are highlighted in red and additions
	are highlighted in green.
	Pull request diffs view can be changed between unified and split (arrow).

</figure>

#### Step 4 - Create Pull Request

Click the green Create Pull Request button to create the pull request. 


#### Step 5 - Title Pull Request
Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.
When you’re done with your message, click Create pull request!

 <figure>
	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/pre-institute-content/pre-institute2-git/Git-PRscreenshot-titlePR-fork.png">
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/pre-institute-content/pre-institute2-git/Git-PRscreenshot-titlePR-fork.png"></a>
	<figcaption> All pull requests titles should be concise and descriptive of
	the content in the pull request. More detailed notes can be left in the comments
	box.

	</figcaption>
</figure>

Check out the repo name up at the top (in your repo and in screenshot above)
When creating the pull request you will be automatically transferred to the base
repo. Since the central repo was the base, github will automatically transfer 
you to the central repo landing page.


#### Step 6 - Merge Pull Request
In this final step, it’s time to merge your changes in the
**NEON-WorkWithData/DI-NEON-participants** repo. 

NOTE 1: You are only able to merge a pull request in a repo that you have
permissions to!

NOTE 2: When collaborating, it is generally poor form to merge your own Pull Request, 
better to tag (@username) a collaborator in the comments so they know you want 
them to look at it. They can then review and, if acceptable, merge it.  

To merge, your (or someone else's PR click the green "Merge Pull Request" 
button to "accept" or merge the updated commits in the central repo into your 
repo. Then click **Confirm Merge**.


We now synced our forked repo with the central NEON Repo. The next step in working 
in a GitHub workflow is to transfer any changes in the central repository into 
your local repo so you can work with them.

## Activity: Submit Pull Request for Week 2 Assignment

Submit a pull request containing the `.md` file that you created in this
tutorial-series series. Before you submit your PR, review the
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/workshop-event/NEON-DI/git-assignment">Week 2 Assignment page</a>.
To ensure you have all of the required elements in your .md file.

To submit your PR:

Repeat the pull request steps above, with the base and head switched. Your base
will be the NEON central repo and your HEAD will be YOUR forked repo:

* base fork: **NEON-WorkWithData/DI-NEON-participants**
* head fork: **YOUR-USER-NAME/DI-NEON-participants**

When you get to Step 6 - Merge Pull Request (PR), are you able to merge the PR?

* Finally, go to the NEON Central Repo page in github.com. Look for the Pull Requests
link at the top of the page. How many Pull Requests are there?
* Click on the link - do you see your Pull Request?

You can only merge a PR if you have permissions in the base repo that you are
adding to. At this point you don’t have contributor permissions to the NEON repo.
Instead someone who is a contributor on the repository will need to review and
accept the request.

</div>

** After completing the pull request to upload your bio markdown file, be sure 
to continue on to <a href="{{ site.basurl }}//reproducible-research/git07" target="_blank">*Git 07: Updating Your Repo by Setting Up a Remote*</a> 
to learn how to update your local fork and really begin
the cycle of working with Git & GitHub in a collaborative manner.** 

## Workflow Summary

### Add updates to Central Repo with Pull Request

On github.com

* Button: Create New Pull Request
* Set base: central Institute repo, set head: your Fork
* Make sure changes are what you want to sync
* Button: Create Pull Request
* Add Pull Request title & comments
* Button: Create Pull Request
* Button: Merge Pull Request - if working collaboratively, poor style to merge 
your own PR, and you only can if you have contributor permissions
