## About

The goals of the 2016 NEON data institute are to:

1. Provide hands-on experience with and knowledge needed to work with NEON remote
sensing data. and,
2. Provide an overview to efficient, reproducible science workflows.

## About The Capstone Project

As a capstone for this Institute, you will break up into small groups, to work on addressing
a science question using NEON and other data.

Important: As you think about this project, consider what may be feasible to explore in a short (~1 days worth) amount of time. You may consider a small pilot project that could potentially be expanded, after you leave the Institute.  


## The Data
You have been given a hard drive containing NEON remote sensing data. You can
also learn more about what NEON data are currently available on our website:

## Document Your Work

 As you work on this project, please be sure to think about efficient workflows.
 This includes:

 * Organize your project data, code and outputs.
 * Write your code in RMD so you can clearly document the steps.

You will submit the code used to work with and process your data, via github.
Please consider:

1. The organization of your working directory
2. The structure, organization and documentation of your code.

We encourage you to do all of your work in .Rmd files!

## Project Presentation

 You will present your project to the group on Saturday, 25 June 2016.
 You might consider creating a presentation using RMD <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/revealjs_presentation_format.html" target="_blank">Create reveal.js presentations using R and R Studio</a>.

## Thursday Afternoon - Get started

On Thursday of the Institute, we will spend some time discussing projects and you
will have time to figure out who you'd like to work with. Note: it is OK if you
would rather work independently, however a goal of this institute is to practice
efficient collaboration skills, so we encourage you to work in groups!

Let's get started:

1. Figure out your group.
2. Figure out what data you will need and how much time you will need / have.
3. Run your idea past one of the Data Institute faculty (Kyla, Naupaka, Leah, Tristan, Dave, etc)
4. Get to work!
