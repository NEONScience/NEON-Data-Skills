#About Raster Data
Raster or "gridded" data are data that are saved in pixels. In the spatial world, 
each pixel represents an area on the Earth's surface. For example in the raster 
below, each pixel represents a particular land cover class that would be found in 
that location in the real world. 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/GIS-Spatial-Data/Working-With-Rasters/"> More on 
rasters here</a>.

raster dataset. Each pixel in the Landsat derived raster represents a landcover
class.</figcaption>
</figure>

To work with rasters in R, we need two key libraries, `sp` and `raster`. 
Let's start by loading these into R. To install the raster library you can use 
`install.packages(‘raster’)`. When you install the raster library, `sp` should 
also install. Also install the `rgdal` library" 
`install.packages(‘rgdal’)`.

	#load the raster, sp, and rgdal packages
	library(raster)
	library(sp)
	library(rgdal)
	#Set your working directory to the folder where your data for this workshop
	#are stored. NOTE: if you created a project file in R studio, then you don't
	#need to set the working directory as it's part of the project.
	setwd("~/yourWorkingDirectoryHere")  
	

Next, let's load the raster into R. Notice that we're using some clever code 
that tells R to paste the working directory into the path, and then it tells it 
to add the location of the raster layer.

	#load raster in an R object called 'DEM'
	DEM <- raster("CHM_InSitu_Data/DigitalTerrainModel/SJER2013_DTM.tif")  
	#next, let's look at the attributes of the raster. 
	DEM
	
OUTPUT:

	class       : RasterLayer 
	dimensions  : 5060, 4299, 21752940  (nrow, ncol, ncell)
	resolution  : 1, 1  (x, y)
	extent      : 254570, 258869, 4107302, 4112362  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
	coord. ref. : +proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0 
	data source : /Users/law/Documents/data/CHM_InSitu_Data/DigitalTerrainModel/SJER2013_DTMHill.tif 
	names       : SJER2013_DTMHill 
	values      : 0, 253  (min, max)
		
Notice a few things about this raster. 

* **Nrow, Ncol** is the number of rows and columns data. 
* **Ncells** is the total number of pixels that make up the raster.
*  **Resolution** is the size of each pixel (in meters in this case)
*  **Extent** this is the spatial extent of the raster. this value will be coordinate units associated with the coordinate reference system of the raster.
*  **Coord ref** this is the coordinate reference system string for the raster. This raster is in UTM (Universal Trans mercator) zone 11 with a datum of WGS 84. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system" target="_blank">More on UTM here</a>.

##Working with Rasters in R
Now that we have the raster loaded into R, let's grab some key metadata.
	DEM@crs
	DEM@extent
	#plot the raster
	plot(DEM)


Also notice it has a resolution and a set of dimension values associated with the raster. This means less work for us!

	DEM
	
OUTPUT:

	class       : RasterLayer 
	dimensions  : 5060, 4299, 21752940  (nrow, ncol, ncell)
	resolution  : 1, 1  (x, y)
	extent      : 254570, 258869, 4107302, 4112362  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
	coord. ref. : +proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0 
	data source : /Users/law/Documents/data/CHM_InSitu_Data/DigitalSurfaceModel/SJER2013_DSM.tif 
	names       : SJER2013_DSM 


## Image vs Plot

R has an `image` function that allows you to better control the way a raster is
rendered on the screen. The `plot` command in R has a base setting for the number
of pixels that it will plot (100,000 pixels). The image command thus might be 
better for rendering larger rasters.

	#let's create a plot of our raster
	image(DEM)
	#specify the range of values that you want to plot in the DEM
	#just plot pixels between 250 and 300 m in elevation
	image(DEM, zlim=c(250,300))

	#we can specify the colors too
	col=terrain.colors(5)
	image(DEM, zlim=c(250,300), col=col)

	#and we can specify the breaks we wish to use
	brk <- c(250, 300, 350, 400,450,500)
	image(DEM, zlim=c(250,300), col=col, breaks=brk)


## Challenge Yourself

1. What happens if you change the number of colors in the terrain.colors command?

[More on colors here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/grDevices/html/palettes.html "More on colors.")

[Another good post on colors.](http://www.r-bloggers.com/color-palettes-in-r/)

2. What happens if you change the zlim values in the image command?
3. What are the other attributes that you can specify when using the image command?



#Cropping Rasters in R

You can crop rasters in R using different methods. You can crop the raster directly 
in the plot area. To do this, first plot the raster. Then define the crop extent 
by clicking twice: 

1. Click in the UPPER LEFT hand corner where you want the crop 
box to begin. 
2. Click again in the LOWER RIGHT hand corner to define where the box ends.
 
You'll see a red box on the plot. NOTE that this is a manual process that can be
used to quickly define a crop extent.

	#plot the DEM
	plot(DEM)
	#Define the extent of the crop by clicking on the plot
	cropbox1 <- drawExtent()
	#crop the raster, then plot the new cropped raster
	DEMcrop1 <- crop(DEM, cropbox1)
	plot(DEMcrop1)

You can also manually assign the extent coordinates to be used to crop a raster. 
We'll need the extent defined as (`xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin` , `ymax`) to do this. 
This is how we'd crop using a GIS shapefile (with a rectangular shape)

	cropbox2 <-c(255077.3,257158.6,4109614,4110934)
	DEMcrop2 <- crop(DEM, cropbox2)
	plot(DEMcrop2)


## Working with multiple rasters within Raster Stacks and Raster Bricks
We've now loaded a raster into R. We've also made sure we knew the `CRS` 
(coordinate reference system) and extent of the dataset among other key metadata 
attributes. Next, let's create a raster stack from 3 raster images.

A raster stack is a collection of raster layers. Each raster layer in the stack 
needs to be in the same projection (CRS), spatial extent and resolution. You 
might use raster stacks for different reasons. For instance, you might want to 
group a time series of rasters representing precipitation or temperature into 
one R object. 

In this lesson, we will stack 3 bands from a multi-band image together to create 
a final RGB image.

The difficult way to do this is to load our rasters one at a time. But that takes
 a good bit of effort. 

	#import tiffs
	band19 <- "CHM_InSitu_Data/DigitalSurfaceModel/band19.tif"
	band34 <- "CHM_InSitu_Data/DigitalSurfaceModel/band34.tif"
	band58 <- "CHM_InSitu_Data//DigitalSurfaceModel/band58.tif"

We can also use the list.files command to grab all of the files in a directory.
We can use `full.names=TRUE` to ensure that R will store the directory path in our list of
rasters.

	#create list of files to make raster stack
	rasterlist <-  list.files('rasterLayers_tif', full.names=TRUE)

NOTE: If your list of rasters is located in your main R working directory, you can
achieve the same results as above by looking for all files with a '.tif' extension:
 `rasterlist <-  list.files('rasterLayers_tif', full.names=TRUE, pattern="tif")`. 

	#create raster stack
	rgbRaster <- stack(rasterlist)

	#check to see that you've created a raster stack and plot the layers
	rgbRaster
	plot(rgbRaster)

 <figcaption>All rasters in the rasterstack plotted.</figcaption>
</figure>



You can also explore the data.


	#look at histogram of reflectance values for all rasters
	hist(rgbRaster)


<figure>
   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/GIS/RGBhist.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/GIS/RGBhist.png"></a>
 <figcaption>Histogram of reflectance values for each raster in the raster stack.</figcaption>
</figure>

	#remember that crop function? You can crop all rasters within a raster stack too
	#finally you can crop all rasters within a raster stack!
	rgbCrop <- c(256770.7,256959,4112140,4112284)
	rgbRaster_crop <- crop(rgbRaster, rgbCrop)
	plot(rgbRaster_crop)

 <figcaption>Histogram of reflectance values for each raster in the raster stack.</figcaption>
</figure>


##Raster Bricks in R
Now we have a list of rasters in a stack. These rasters are all the same extent CRS and resolution but a raster brick will create one raster object in R that contains all of the rasters we can use this object to quickly create RGB images!

	#create raster brick
	RGBbrick <- brick(rgbRaster)
	plotRGB(RGBbrick,r=3,g=2,b=1, scale=800, stretch = "Lin")

## Write a raster to a Geotiff File in R

We can write out the raster in tiff format as well. When we do this it will copy the CRS, extent and resolution information so the data will read properly into a GIS as well. Note that this writes the raster in the order they are in - in the stack. In this case, the blue (band 19) is first but it's looking for the red band first (RGB). One way around this is to generate a new raster stack with the rasters in the proper order - red, green and blue format.

	#Make a new stack in the order we want the data in: 
	finalRGBstack <- stack(rgbRaster$band58,rgbRaster$band34,rgbRaster$band19)
	#write the geotiff - change overwrite=TRUE to overwrite=FALSE if you want to make sure you don't overwrite your files!
	writeRaster(finalRGBstack,"rgbRaster.tiff","GTiff", overwrite=TRUE)
