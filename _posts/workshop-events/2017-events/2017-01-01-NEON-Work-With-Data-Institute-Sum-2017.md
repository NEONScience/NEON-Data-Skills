NEON's Data Institutes provide critical skills and foundational knowledge for 
graduate students and early career scientists working with heterogeneous 
spatio-temporal data to address ecological questions. 

## June 2017: Remote Sensing with Reproducible Workflows
Our 2017 Institute focused on remote sensing of vegetation using open source 
tools and reproducible science workflows -- the primary **programming language will 
be Python**. This Institute will be held at NEON headquarters in June 2017.

In addition to the 6 day institute there are three weeks of pre-institute materials is
to ensure that everyone comes to the Institute ready to work in a collaborative 
research environment. Pre-institute materials are online & individually paced, expect to
spend 1-5 hrs/week depending on your familiarity with the topic.

### Online Resources
The teaching materials from the 2017 Data Institute will be available as 
self-paced online tutorials after the Institute. In the meantime, you can access 
the 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/workshop-event/NEON-Work-With-Data-Insitute-2016" target="_blank">2016 Data Institute materials here</a>.
These 2016 materials were designed to be used in the context of the workshop with an 
instructor. In 2016, the primary **programming language was R**.

### Instructors

**Dr. Tristan Goulden**, Associate Scientist-Airborne Platform, Battelle-NEON: 
Tristan is a remote sensing scientist with NEON specializing in LiDAR. 
He also co-lead NEON’s Remote Sensing IPT (integrated product team) which focusses 
on developing algorithms and associated documentation for all of NEON’s remote 
sensing data products.  His past research focus has been on characterizing 
uncertainty in LiDAR observations/processing and propagating the uncertainty into 
downstream data products. During his PhD, he focused on developing uncertainty 
models for topographic attributes (elevation, slope, aspect), hydrological products 
such as watershed boundaries, stream networks, as well as stream flow and erosion 
at the watershed scale. His past experience in LiDAR has included all aspects of 
the LIDAR workflow including; mission planning, airborne operations, processing 
of raw data, and development of higher level data products. During his graduate 
research he applied these skills on LiDAR flights over several case study 
watersheds of study as well as some amazing LiDAR flights over the Canadian 
Rockies for monitoring change of alpine glaciers. His software experience for 
LiDAR processing includes Applanix’s POSPac MMS, Optech’s LMS software, Riegl’s 
LMS software, LAStools, Pulsetools,  TerraScan, QT Modeler, ArcGIS, QGIS, 
Surfer, and self-written scripts in Matlab for point-cloud, raster, and 
waveform processing.

<a href="http://naupaka.net/" target="_blank">**Dr. Naupaka Zimmerman**, Assistant Professor of Biology, University of San Francisco:</a> 
Naupaka’s research focuses on the microbial ecology of plant-fungal interactions. 
Naupaka brings to the course experience and enthusiasm for reproducible workflows 
developed after discovering how challenging it is to keep track of complex analyses 
in his own dissertation and postdoctoral work. As a co-founder of the International 
Network of Next-Generation Ecologists and an instructor and lesson maintainer for 
Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry, Naupaka is very interested in providing and 
improving training experiences in open science and reproducible research methods.

**Bridget Hass**, Remote Sensing Data Processing Technician, Battelle-NEON: 
Bridget’s daily work includes processing LiDAR and hyperspectral data collected 
by NEON's Aerial Observation Platform (AOP).  Prior to joining NEON, Bridget 
worked in marine geophysics as a shipboard technician and research assistant. 
She is excited to be a part of producing NEON's AOP data and to share techniques 
for working with this data during the 2017 Data Institute.

<a href="https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/computing-for-life/" target="_blank">**Dr. Paul Gader**, Professor, University of Florida:</a> 
Paul is a Professor of Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) 
at the Engineering School of Sustainable Infrastructure and the Environment 
(ESSIE) at the University of Florida(UF). Paul received his Ph.D. in Mathematics 
for parallel image processing and applied mathematics research in 1986 from UF, 
spent 5 years in industry,  and has been teaching at various universities since 
1991. His first research in image processing was in 1984 focused on algorithms 
for detection of bridges in Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) imagery. He has 
investigated algorithms for land mine research since 1996, leading a team that 
produced new algorithms and  real-time software for a sensor system currently 
operational in Afghanistan. His landmine detection projects involve algorithm 
development for data generated from hand-held, vehicle-based, and airborne 
sensors, including ground penetrating radar, acoustic/seismic, broadband IR 
(emissive and reflective bands), emissive and reflective hyperspectral imagery, 
and wide-band electro-magnetic sensors.  In the past few years, he focused on  
algorithms for imaging spectroscopy. He is currently researching nonlinear 
unmixing for object and material detection, classification and segmentation, and 
estimating plant traits. He has given tutorials on nonlinear unmixing at 
International Conferences. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronic Engineers, an Endowed Professor at the University of Florida, was 
selected for a 3-year term as a UF Research Foundation Professor, and has over 
100 refereed journal articles and over 300 conference articles.
